The right reader of a good poem can tell the moment it strikes him that he has taken an immortal wound--that he will never get over it. That is to say, permanence in poetry, as in love, is perceived instantly. It hasn't to await the test of time. The proof of a poem is not that we have never forgotten it, but we knew at sight we never could forget it.' -Robert Frost      "

But dammit, he's NOT K!    Yes, Yes, I'm officially pining!  What the hell is my problem?  I get asked out nearly every day, and K--is immune to me.  How odd that feels to be immune to someone. I don't feel like ice, nor even cool water.  I feel like a piece of dry and brittle wood.  A long hard piece of wood that you would find in the back yard; maybe, an extra piece of fencing that you had forgotten about. But all the same it is there fading from that deep red fence color to sun blanched.  There are these little holes all about it, and on one side, it's still moist and wet from where it rests in the dirt.  I taste the moist earth in my mouth today!  I'm getting a cold too; maybe I'm love sick?  I don't know, but nonetheless, I just don't feel good today. I had to shut off the radio.

Since I didn't sleep too well last night, I sat up in the dark thinking about how quick K was to correct my speech!  What a polarity from EB!  I remembered how I suddenly got stupid around EB, and he was always so gracious.  He would get stupid too; we could barely remember what we were reading at the time.  LOVE IN THE TIME OF CHOLERA!!! How prophetic indeed!  But still, EB would have said, 'Oh, don't worry about how you speak; I get you!'  He'd look into my eyes, and it was just clear and simple; My eyes against his eyes--a mirror!    But K!  I can never tell; it seems at times he looks at me as if he is hungry, or in search of something, and then more than often it is just a look like something you would smell in a circle k or seven eleven.  He looks at me causally as if one were deciding which pair of white socks to wear for the day...  And how I look at him?  I suppose it is a long simple glance that says, 'If you only knew...' Or maybe one that says, 'Touch me!'  Ok well, now I see I'm sounding incredibly ridiculous and pining away too!    I've got to go... Jumbled Chaos "
883178,male,Fashion,"           This from my Concert Friend Who is One Sharp Cookie By Duf Fer   ...in my opinion, the fact that we sat down for about 1/4 of the REM songs wasn't a reflection of us, but rather the songs. You really can't rock out to Nightswimming or Everybody Hurts. I'd say even 20 year olds would sit down during ballads.  I also think in Minnesota, perhaps more than in other states, there is definitely a herd mentality. People stand up if others stand up and don't if they don't. I'm definitely included in that, myself. I feel a great deal of social pressure not to stand if the people around me, especially behind me, aren't standing. That was true 15 years ago and it was true Tuesday. I remember years ago going to concerts and wondering why no one was dancing. I do think a younger crowd is more likely to stand because young people are more self-absorbed than others. But no one sat during any of the Fleetwood Mac concert and as we've discussed, that was the very definition of yuppy concert. I don't think there was much sitting during the Paul McCartney concert, but I can't say for sure. I do remember there was a jackass talking loudly during a lot of it, which was VERY annoying!   I think she is right.  I feel that song selection was an energy drain, and R.E.M. has its share of ballads that really play well on enduring albums and can be fine in concerts.  They have enough up tempo rocking tunes to keep things high too.  I also feel pressure to sit if the people behind me aren't standing.  I once had my life threatened at an Indigo Girls concert...          "

2635745,female,Student,"       It's been a few days.  I've started a diary for extremely personal moments so I don't think I'll write that often.  I had an okay day.  I spoke with Ferrell about five times today.  He was being a little perverted, but then he got serious when I asked him how he was.  He looked miserable.  He had a long face and looked really tired.  He smiled when I asked him and I really sent a rush of glee through me.  He made some funny jokes, but I don't feel like telling them.  Jake was acting weird.  He thanked me for inviting him to the party and then asked me if we missed him after he left.  It is so weird, he is such a ladies man and no one knows why.  Then I spoke to Hamburger.  He still tried to mess with me and I told him how I enjoyed the conversation we had when he thought I was Chelsea and how he asked me if Liz, Morgan, and I fell for their joke, thinking that I was Chelsea.  Chelsea confessed when I told her what happened.  Ha it was funny.  She's great.  It was cool today.  Walking down the halls today I found that there was always someone at my side from class to class.  On my way to 4th I was in between both Hamburger and Ferrell.  That felt satisfying because I've always been the weirdo and to have two sophomore guys on my arms felt nice.  And I was scary, Ferrell actually did that clingy thing where you hook your arms.  He grabbed my arm.  It was a really different side of him.  Huh.  I'll leave on this note.  Until Later.         "

766556,female,indUnk,"        That's interesting   Well, friends, after having seen 'Pirates of the Caribbean' last night, I have to say that the quiz down there was right.  I am most like Jack Sparrow.  I mean, you know, without the heavy black eye makeup, the braided goatee, the gold teeth and the really dirty fingernails *yuck*.  And I'm not quite as quircky as that character.  At least I don't think I am; although some of my friends may argue that point.  But there are many similarities; for example people will often underestimate my capabilities.  And god knows I get by on more luck than strategy.  I do have a tendency to wax verbose and poetic, and I have a very deep-seated faith in my self and in who I am.  I genuinely believe that as long as I stay focused on my goal, I will achieve it.  Its completely unthinkable that I won't finally get exactly what I want.  And then there's that whole lust for freedom that we share.  The movie had its strengths and weaknesses.  Also, being a Disney movie, it couldn't help but poke fun at the ride at Disney World.  The little dog with the key outside the cell... that's in the movie.  And Capt. Jack Sparrow makes a clever joke about the dog - but not everyone in the theater laughed.  Maybe they've never been.    I laughed a lot, and I left there feeling really good.  That's what a movie should do, I think.  I felt elated and free when I walked out of the theater; sort of like Jack in the closing scene as he stood at the helm and headed for the horizon.

4192173,male,Technology,"             Blog blog blog. Dear Bloggie...  Just got back from the Bradley J. Fox nuptuals in Chicago. Good time and good to see former aggression members as well. I think we have Mr. Linq locked in for an appearance on HF2. He has the demos and was digging them quite a bit when we parted ways. He and Nina should be popping into MOGworld next week. Came home to find the 24 marathon in full effect. Needless to say, I am a big 24 mark and was suckered in immediately as was Mr. G 70 blocks away.  The new aggression remix EP takes shape. Needleye has finished their remix and it's on it's way. I don't even know which song I sent them! SINO from Japan has agreed to do a remix and Brand't is getting the parts ready as we speak. The Russians have finished one and have asked if they could do more! Can't complain about that.  Saw the family Novak while in Chicago for a fun evening. It was good to be there in a non work situation. Which of course meant Jason and I went straight into the studio to listen to the Crack works in progress. With the Novak kids asleep, the grown-ups fast-forwarded through the much discussed MTV awards. The Madonna/Britney thing was a snooze, but Jack Black is a genius. Anyway, I thought the Duran Lifetime achievement award was a great idea on paper, but was executed poorly. Still, to see them on TV was great...and speaking of the Durans...  On the 27th, my 31st Bday, some of the crew caught Duran at their intimate gig at Webster Hall and by god was it incredible. Please refer to my previous post from the gig I saw last month and apply it here, except 500x better, which quite possibly makes this my favorite gig of all time. it was a shorter set, but we left that gig drained and amazed. I was also glad to see that the last gig wasn't a fluke and these guys mean it. Just see any recent review in the NY papers and you'll see. Amazing.  Spinning the new BRMC CD at the moment, so far, they have avoided the sophomore jinx. So far.  Chemlab's drop date is supposedly the 3rd week of October. I designed a Chem Tshirt that hopefully some of you will be wearing soon. A new project with Jared (not Chemlab) is in the planning stages and should be the project I segue into after the recording of HF2, though bough projects might run simultaneously.    Brandt tells me I have some work to do on SOLAR. I like the sound of that!  F           "

883178,male,Fashion,"           Hi kids,  I've had a nice collection of days off - over the weekend I was in my friend 'Kat's' adorable wedding.  Though the event was great, being in the small town freaked me out.  I actually saw a bumper sticker that said 'First Iraq, Now France'.  And that's not the only nutso political expression I saw.  Ewwww.  Then on Monday, Duf and I drove to Chi, met up with Panda and spent a couple of beautiful, intimate hours with Chris Martin and his band.  You might know his band as 'Coldplay'.  I know them as 'HAL's Collection of Future Husbands'.  Thanks to Panda's efforts, we were on the floor just a few feet from the stage.  I thought Chris did a great job of playing the show just for me, while not making the rest of the crowd feel completely ignored.  I thought that I did a great job of expressing my enthusiasm, while not earning a restraining order.  Chris is a good guy, and a great dancer.  He wasn't as goofy as he was in Phoenix (no boy-band falsetto impressions this time), but all was forgiven when he got on his guitar and did his 'back and forth' move.  For me.  After the show, we caught a few zzz's before heading back to Minneapolis yesterday.  Panda was again the true trooper - she went to bed at 2, and got up at 4 to catch her plane to NYC.  She's my hero.  I love rock and roll.         "

1708471,female,indUnk,"            Warning:  Could include some graphic sences, but I will try not to make this too graphic.  I've never so much in my life realized what a gift it is to own more than one kleenex box, for that matter I've never so much in my life realized what a gift it is to own one kleenex box. As I sit here typing on the computer I constantly reach over for the pink tissues of Kleenex brand. I've had a cold for about a week now, and this cold has all the horrors, I have a cough, but it gets worse when I laugh, I'm somewhat lightheaded, and of course my nose is incredibly irritated and stuffy and blah, I don't really want to go into detail. So every time I go to blow my nose I feel so relieved as if I just got some huge burden off my chest, yet, it comes back to torture me again in less then 5 minutes. However, once the feeling comes back again, I still have my trusty kleenexs by my side.  I've realized how much pain you go through without the kleenexs by your side, both emotionally, mentally, and physically. I was sitting in Echo today thinking about how much I could really use a kleenex, but how there weren't any by me at this time. This mad me want to cry, I depended on them so much, I suffer if I don't have them with me, and they weren't in that class room at all. Sure I could go to the bathroom and use toliet paper or paper towels, but first of all that would include me leaving the couch and second, they just aren't fun to use. So instead I used the napkins that were already in the room. This sure doesn't do any better than the paper towel, but I needed one so bad, it was strating to drive me insane. So I blow my nose and does it hurt. After usuing napkins and paper towels, your nose gets ten times dryer then it was before and it also scratches your nose, not so fun. If I were to have used a kleenex however, it would have been nice an soft and I would have kept on coming back for more, I guess you could say they're addictive.   The worst time to need a kleenex is during hockey, here you can let it flow.... through and out your nose and well just not caring.... except one hit and bam.... everything just flows out like an erupting volcano, not the prettiest thing to see. The alternative though is bringing a box of kleenex or something to the bench and when you get that 5 second break, undo your face max and blow the hell out of your nose, and then see there is no garbage by you on the ice, you have to either just leave it there for everyone or taking it at the end.   Through my experiences I've learned to always carry tissues with you no matter if you  have a cold or not or no matter where you are. They're very useful and efficient and I give props to whomever invented them. So if you don't have any soft kleenexs in your house, please go get some for your sake  and everyone elses, it's not to pleasent to see you wiping your nose on your shirt, and if you are, I really hope it isn't someone elses.   This issue has been brought to you by: ME! Yes me... Kati!         "

3581210,male,InvestmentBanking,"             If anything, Korea is a country of extremes.  Everything here seems fad-based.  I think it may come from Korea's history.  It has been invaded a reported 700 times over the years, and each time they got independence I imagine they had to move quickly to get to the next level before the next war or occupation.  Lately (well, not really lately...in 1945) the Japanese Occupation ended.  Then the Korean War occurred from 1950-3.  After that there was turmoil, but in 1961 Park Chung Hee took over as dictator/president.  He had elections, in which everyone was 'encouraged' to vote, but he was still a dictator.  After his assassination in 1979 the next few leaders were basically of the same ilk.  President Park did some amazing things in his time, however.  He took an incredibly backward country and set it on the road to industrialization. Japan had stripped Korea of its resources, people and even its language and culture (many buildings and palaces were razed and Japanese was the official language here from 1910-1945) but President Park was determined to change that.  He orchestrated the 'Han River Miracle' (the Han River, or Hangang 한강 is the main river in Seoul/Korea) and Korea made terrific strides, if at the expense of some civil liberties.  Fastforward to the present, and my point, and we see that Korea is the world's #1 wired nation.  More than Canada, Finland and way beyond the U.S.A.  There was a craze to have PC방s (PC bangs or rooms) EVERYWHERE in the country.  As well, instead of PlayStation-like games where players go against the computer or one or two people, Korean gamers (always the communal types) play online games with hundreds or thousands of others. in typical Korean fashion, gamers who left their seat for a second could not pause their game...in fact, they may be eliminated.  So PCbang owners sold drinks, ramen nooodles and other junk to their clientele.  It was just a matter of time before someone died, as related in  urlLink this article .  Yes, someone died from being on the PC.  People thought he was just sleeping (imagine how long he was there before they really checked him out) but, alas, he was the first known casulty of the Net in Korea, maybe the world.  Korea, built on extremes, both good and bad.         "
4063217,female,Law,"   Life has suddenly become hectic.  The title of this post is so accurate.  I've suddenly become booked for depositions, hearings, meetings, and so on that were not expected.  I truly hate going into a deposition on an hour's notice and not knowing a thing in the world about the case.  It doesn't help that the other associate in the office is causing us great worry.  He looks like he may have a breakdown soon.  I sincerely hope not because if he does, I won't be far behind.  School has started back, so our law clerks have returned to class and left us to fend for ourselves.  I kind of miss them.  They at least gave me something to smile about, not to mention that they certainly improved the view around the place.  That also means that my kids have gone back to school also.  In case I haven't mentioned it, I've got four kids, ages 12, 11, 9, and 7.  Boy, girl, girl, and boy.  The boys live with their dad during the school year and the girls live with me, so I do have a little help with them.  You would think that my life would be easier with them at school, but I leave for work about the time they go to school and I get back after they're home.  Now, I've got homework to deal with as well as getting them fed, bathed, and in bed before midnight.  Guitar lessons also started back for my 9 year old.  She is convinced that she's going to be a rock star when she grows up.  I must admit, she's gotten pretty good at playing Yankee Doodle.  She thinks she's ready to start playing Skynard riffs though.  More power to her.  She's still undecided if she wants to be a rock star, a lawyer, or a teacher--or maybe all three.  The older one wants to be a fashion designer.  She's a little too girly for my tastes, but hey, she is a girl after all.  I must admit that I don't agree with her on alot of things.  For example, we had a debate last week over a crown.  She ordered a bunch of crowns, tiaras, etc. from a catalog and she did not think it was appropriate for me to wear the king's crown because I was a girl.  I don't think I ever did convince her that the simple fact that I was female did not prohibit me from being king if I wanted to be.  I guess, to be technical, the definition of king does include male, but nothing says it has to be that way.  Hmmph.  I am doing one girly thing lately though.  I'm learning to cook.  I don't mean throwing something in the microwave and heating it up, which is my normal routine, but really cooking.  You know, with the use of a stove and recipes and stuff.  It's pretty cool.  I'm really into baking, but even though I follow the recipe, the mixtures I concoct generally end up being runnier than they're supposed to be.  Tip of the day:  When baking teacakes (aka cookie-like substinence) and the recipe calls for you to roll the dough out and cut the cakes before placing on the pan, do it.  Otherwise you end up with a huge pan of run-together cookie/cake mess that is rather unattractive.  Of course, in that situation, you're in luck whether your guests like cookies or cake.

3309662,male,Internet,"       Went to see Spiderman 2 last night - have to say that I liked it - didn't have the fun of the first one when you were learning how they were going to implement all the superpowers and stuff but still good none the less.  Some soppy bits - to be expected in a blockbuster these days - but the effects were good and the action scenes were well put together.  Special effects weren't as jaw dropping as The Day After Tomorrow that I saw last week - never has a film with such a weak story line been saved so well by special effects in my opinion.  Oh, and I've found out that I'll have a  choice  as to where I can watch the Euro 2004 final.  There's a bar in Arlington - Summers - and, if I'm too hung over, there's always Comcast PPV :)         "

My thoughts on James Lileks you ask? Nobody does it better.  If his 'Bleat' is not a daily 'must read' for you, your life is that much poorer without your even knowing it.  Seriously.  An observation from today's Opinion Jounal: Stanley's colleague Adam Nagourney tries to find hope for the Democrats: 'Some Republicans said the images of a forceful Mr. Reagan giving dramatic speeches on television provided a less-than-welcome contrast with Mr. Bush's own appearances these days, and that it was not in Mr. Bush's interest to encourage such comparisons.'   Well, maybe. Certainly Bush isn't as eloquent as Reagan was. Then again, neither is John Kerry. When Bush speaks, you often imagine Reagan might have said the same thing better. When Kerry speaks, you imagine Reagan would disagree--assuming he could even figure out what Kerry was saying.    Update:  Holy shit, I've got  urlLink tears in my eyes .           "

It's always enjoyable to worship and fellowship with the women there. I'm enjoying the book my group is going through 'Do You Think I'm Beautiful?' Then in the afternoons I usually go to the grocery store and run various errands. Then by the time I pick up Ked and we make it home we have time to grab a quick bite to eat and head to Life Group. But we didn't make it to Life Group tonight and we were supposed to lead tonight! Oh well. Ked is still feeling sick and he wasn't feeling good at all when he got home from work. He crashed on the couch and I called us in sick.  Anyway, not much to say tonight. My brain is pretty fried. I've spent the last few hours scrapbooking our Alaska pictures and I think I've hit my wall! I'm almost done with them which is absolutely amazing considering there were over 200 pictures to scrapbook! I'm pretty pleased with the album. It's so much fun to scrapbook all these amazing pictures that Ked took and remember what a great time we had. That feels like so long ago...so much has happened since then. That's what scrapbooks are for. To preserve all those memories.  Night y'all               "
3022585,female,Education,"       Morehead City, NC.  On the Bogue Sound.  When you hit Morehead City limits you know you are at the beach.  Windows are being rolled down and the warm, musty salt air begins to hit your face.  Your hair begins to curl almost instantly.  You know good grits are on their way too because beach water makes the best grits.  You cross the bridge over the Bogue Sound and see a glimpse of that magical water, part lake, part ocean, part river, all saltwater and controlled by the tides.  There are clams and oysters and sand dollars and porpoises in this water too and you wish you were staying on the sound.  At the light after the bridge you take a right toward pine knoll shores, just a few miles away from Atlantic Beach, from you childhood.    The house sits in front of the ocean, facing what seems to be an endless amount of water.  You can’t believe there is actually something beyond the point that your eye can’t see.  The horizon is so far away that you see whole clouds from top to bottom in the distance.  Some nights, there are storms at sea, you see the lightning, but the rain and thunder never make it to shore.  You wonder what good a storm at sea does, were any boats caught in it?    Some days the wind is so strong on the beach that you have to stay in or go to the inlet or to Fort Macon or a day trip to Beaufort.  Some days there is no wind and the heat comes off the sand like it is willing you to leave.  Some days the rain comes in at lunchtime and moves you from your saltwater post.  Everyday, you want more, more sand clinging to your toes, more saltwater up your nose.  The ocean pummels and turns you out.  You keep going back to it.  In low tide there are tidal pools a short distance from the dune.  These are your favorite. There is enough seawater to float you on a raft and as the tide is leaving there are enough waves to keep you moving.  The tidal pool is the best of all worlds, no thought of a rip current and all the luxury of   On calm nights the moon glows in the sky so bright that the reflection off the water mimics daytime.  You swear you could see by it.  You know that nighttime is the best time on the beach.  The beach is yours then because no else ventures to the beach at night.  You sit on the deck and look at the horizon or the shape of the moon.  You feel like you have a secret that no one else really wants to know about.  How could anyone not love the beach more at night?  You don’t understand the fascination with the daytime, the sun and the rain, when the nighttime brings the moon and crabs and loggerhead turtles.  You know the secret and though you try to share it, others prefer sleep.     Soon you must leave the crystal coast of North Carolina.  No other beaches in the world will compare.  There is simplicity and elegance in North Carolina’s crystal coast.  There are very few trappings of fancy dwellings or pools seamlessly flowing into the ocean.  There are just beach houses, many are old, and some are new or just well kept.  But the house isn’t important, it’s the beach the matters.  It’s the weather and the sand and the promise of good shell hunts.  It’s suntans and bathing suits and rinsing off before you come inside.  It’s a morning swim then lunch then back again then dinner out.  It’s beach towels draped over the deck at the end of the day.  It’s the day’s catch on the pier or at the surf.  It’s floppy hats and sun visors and sunscreen and big umbrellas.  It’s rafts and buckets and shovels and sandcastles.  It’s enduring the grit of the sand and the stickiness of the water.  It’s the oldies station on the radio and it’s your family all around.  It’s the beach in North Carolina and part of you doesn’t ever want to leave.           "

4291530,female,indUnk,"   Hey everyone,  This weekend we were very busy! And we've had a lot of help from our friends. Our neighbors, William and Marie, are very sweet to us and we're always doing something with them throughout the week. William works for a towing company and Marie is a stay at home wife. They live with William's mom, Ida, who is currently having chemo for her breast cancer. She's doing okay, and we've been to see her a few times at the hospital when she stays there. In any case, William and Jeff love to play Diablo 2 together and are constantly talking about the game. William came over on Friday afternoon and told Jeff he needed to move our car. Jeff was a little confused and William said we needed to move our car next to his tow truck so he can fix our flat tire. Yes, our tire was flat! We knew that we had a screw in the tire, but we hadn't gotten around to fixing it yet. Turns out there was a slow leak and so our tire was slowly loosing air. So William popped out the screw, used his tire repair kit and we were all set to go. And William told us normally he'd charge 45 dollars for his services but for us, all he wants is Jeff to deck out his necromancer on Diablo 2. Which Jeff does happily!  Saturday Jeff and I wanted to put up our new chandelier in our stairwell. We've had this chandelier in a box in our living room for about 2 months waiting to get a ladder to hang it up with. Our old one was, well, old. One socket was broken and it was missing all of the glass cups around the light bulbs. The house was built in the 70's and I think that was the original chandelier. Needless to say, we needed a new one. So we got it and it sat in it's box forever. We asked around and my boss at work, Tammy, had a ladder. We just needed to go pick it up to use. Much better than buying one or renting one! So we decided to go down to Tammy's house and pick it up. We took Cinder with us because Tammy had been wanting to meet the puppy. She has a puppy too so we've been swapping stories at work.  We got to her house, and her puppy did not like Cinder, but Cinder was fascinated with Coco. Coco is a Chihuahua and Cinder is bigger than Coco and all Cinder wanted to do was play. But Coco would have none of that. We laughed a lot at them while we were cleaning off the ladder.  And then we tried to get the ladder into our car. We opened all the doors, the windows, put the seats down, everything. No such luck. We thought about tying it to the top of the car but that's a little dangerous. Tammy graciously offered to let us use her van for the day. So we loaded the ladder up, and drove back home.  Jeff got the chandelier up in about 2 hours. It looks fantastic. It's sort of a rustic look, blackened copper and clean lines, no flashiness. It has brightened up the stairwell a ton. In light and in style. It makes the house seem that much more put together. It's amazing what a nice light will do in the house!  After we dropped Tammy's car back off for her (no Cinder this time), we went to Tyson's Corner, a fantastic mall in our area, and bought Jeff new Sunday shoes. His old ones had split off from their soles and you could see his socks through the toes. So new shoes were needed! We found some nice ones at a shoe store in the mall. We also got some things that I needed for Primary on Sunday.  We also went to Target to get another light for our extra bedroom so when people come to stay, they have light in their room! We also got a few bathroom fixtures like a towel rack and a toilet paper roll. A very productive trip. :) We had dinner in a Mexican cafe right near there, and walked around the lake in the shopping area.  When we got home, Jeff put together the lamp and hung the bathroom fixtures while I played with the puppy. All in all, a busy and productive Saturday.  On Sunday, it was my Sunbeams' turn to teach sharing time, which means it was MY turn to teach sharing time. I was really nervous about it. Our theme for the month was 'How can I strengthen myself and my home through faith, repentance, and prayer?' So, I looked at the sharing time helps on  urlLink http://www.lds.org  and came up with one using the shield of faith and darts. See D&C 27: 15, 17. Jeff and I made 'fiery' darts from pipe cleaners and I taped them under a few chairs in primary. For every dart, I had something that could harm the faith in our houses or ourselves like 'You've just come home from church and your friend wants you to go to the movies with him. What should you do?' or 'You're really hungry and your mom is busy doing laundry. You want to eat lunch as soon as you can. What should you do?' That one got a lot of interesting responses. Ranging from 'make something yourself' to 'don't be so hungry!' In any case, Jeff made a shield out of a poster board and we wrote faith on it and had the kids who didn't have darts, come and hold the shield and respond to the problems. It was very cute and they had some really good answers. It went really well and I was pleased about that.  My Sunbeam class is growing in leaps and bounds! I started off with just 2 girls, and I now have 4 little girls (Shelby, 4, Kennan, 4, Katy, 3 and Hannah, 3) and a boy who is visiting for about a month (Zach, 4). They keep me on my toes. Their lesson this week was on I am thankful for my home. I was talking about a picture of a blossoming tree and they all piped up that it was the popcorn-popping tree! So we sang the song, and they proceeded to talk about what type of popcorn they had at their house. It was funny, but WAY off the topic. We got back to talking about who lives in trees and went from there. One thing that I introduced a few weeks ago as part of the lesson is selling Joseph into Egypt as a game. They each took turns being Joseph and everyone who was left were his brothers. I was the pharaoh, and the 'brothers' sold 'Joseph' to me and then came to ask for food. It was a very cute game and we have played it every Sunday for a month. Who knew it would be so popular.  We were able to play Diablo 2 with my dad as we do every Sunday. I think Dad and I died about 10 times. Good thing we're not hardcore players or we'd loose everything every time we died. We really look forward to playing every Sunday with Dad. :)  Sunday night we watched some of the Olympics that we had taped earlier. I've been following the swimming, and of course, the horses. We watched the stadium jumping finals and Germany won. USA came in 4th by like .2 points. I just enjoyed watching all the beautiful horses!  That's all for now! Check back frequently for updates! :) Love ya all, Catherine and Jeff   "

I had put my blood, sweat, and tears into planning a great networking/social event at Second City (a legendary comedy club here in Chi) for my grad school alumni, and what did I do to celebrate?  I got plowed with the Dean of the business school.  When he made a speech and asked me to stand up to be recognized for my hard work on the board of directors, I remember the act of standing up felt like an extremely daunting task.  * Just when my addiction to cable had gotten to the point where I actually considered a 12-step program, it was cut off.  Completely.  No more cable, free or paid for.  I guess I'll have to take up needlepoint or something, cuz I'm not quite sure what I'll do with all this additional free time.  * I got suckered into attending a SOLD OUT  urlLink Rick Springfield  show tonight.

And now...the Friday 5.   1. What food do you like that most people hate?  I really like to dip carrots in peanut butter.  A lot of people give me grossed out looks when I do that.  How is that so different from putting celery in peanut butter?  Could someone please explain?   2. What food do you hate that most people love?  I'm OK with sushi rolls (particularly wimpy California rolls), but I hate all other sushi.  It's funny, because when I'm in NY, everyone always wants to go out for sushi.  When I tell them that's not my cup of tea, I ALWAYS get this same response: 'You don't like sushi?  But you  look  like you would like sushi.'  I  look  like I would like sushi??  What does that even mean?  Is it my hairstyle?  My shoes?  My bra size?  I am dumbfounded.   3. What famous person, whom many people may find attractive, is most unappealing to you?  Someone must think Britney Spears is good-looking.  Otherwise, she'd stop making her slutty videos and selling her crap music.  Personally, I think she looks like a damn carnie.  Her legs are kind of squat-like, but I suppose her short skirt/high boot outfit combo doesn't help give the illusion of longer legs.  Someone needs to tell her to stop wearing that shit.   4. What famous person, whom many people may find unappealing, do you find attractive?  It used to be Bachelor Bob, until I realized he was as big a tool as any other guy out there.  There, I've said it.  Bob's a pig.  But to answer the question, I think  urlLink Sarah Polley  is unbelievably gorgeous.  She has an average-girl look to her, but when she's on-screen, she shines.     5. What popular trend baffles you?  PDAs.  Don't like 'em.  Won't get one.  Don't try to convince me otherwise. (Granted, I also said that about cell phones at one point, and now I'm a total cell phone whore.)          "

So now we're together again.&nbsp; I really don't know what to think.&nbsp; I'm afraid to get emotionally invested again, for fear of a repeat.&nbsp; And if there is a repeat, I'm in this place where it could completely alienate me from him.&nbsp; This is the third time we've gotten back together and I don't knowreally what to do, or how to act.

589736,male,Technology,"           Think of it as a family for a second.  My father has 2 sisters and 1 brother.  They bicker and argue with each other quite a bit (at least they did when they were younger).  But, if someone outside the family, even one of the spouses of the four siblings, were to say something derogatory about one of them, the other three will circle the wagons and defend the other, even if what was said was true or something that one of them had said before.  That is the way it is here.  We can bicker amongst ourselves, bitch about the government, and even leave the country for a change, but if someone outside of here tells us we need to change or attacks us (verbally  or physically), we will tell you in no uncertain words to go f*** yourself.  Burning the flag pisses alot of Americans off.  However, it does not bother me as much to see foreigners do it in foreign countrys.  It does bother me to see protestors in the US do it, because by doing so, they are saying to me that they do not like the lifestyle the US lets them lead.  The lifestyle that allows them to burn the flag without being arrested or shot.  As for the security issue, the same NBC report said that security was already higher than normal because of some intelligence indicating a possible Al Queda attack.  They actually had some British official discussing that briefly in the report.         "

So FC is releasing a new set of tools for people who don't use Outlook. There's a 30 day trial and I'm already in love! This here is an attempt to use the PlanPlus Note taking system to back up my blogging. Hmmm - I note that there's no spell check ....  The beautiful part is that the goals tasks and missions are drag & droppable, they're right here! There's a whole section for planning your week and it starts at the Mision statement. Then it takes you to your goals - this is terrific - you can look over the steps of a goal and drag it into your week! It's so much easier to keep my priorites straight when the planning sessions automatically begins with the things I value most.  I'm dying to use this! I'm still going to check out the Outlook version but Franklin Covey has made a bigger fan out of me!       "

'i feel' and 'i have a weird feeling...' in this case does not refer to loving someone...but obviously you wouldn't know what its like to love someone now would you? *glare ^__^* i'm also questioning whether jono is human - being moody is natural when someone feels sad or depressed and it is only when it occurs in excess and to an unbearable extent can it be classified as PMS. '[feelin] regretful' is also another  human  quality which jono obviously lacks. pfft.  jono...you are clearly bored --- i don't think playing so many games of DDR, watching Mean Girls, followed by soccer training was beneficial to your brain whatsoever.

I always get a kick out of the Referrer spot on my blog, the place that tracks web referrences to this page; in a most unscientific and sporadic way.  I once read a blog page that added symbols to misspell a popular current topic, just to avoid being referred to in search engines.  Now I see why.  I get some of the weirdest mentions on that little referrer!  And, sadly, sometimes that referrer is more entertaining than my blog.  What sparked my comments today was the 'miami beach shitty fireworks' search.  First of all, why would anyone search in that specific way?  What exactly were they looking for?  Second, I didn't mention fireworks on the beach in my blog... did I?   Maybe I did.  Anyway, I think its funny because, obviously, I am not the only one with that opinion of this year's fireworks.  And, perhaps, the searcher was there too.  Sitting on Miami Beach, with me and 49,998 other spectators, waiting and waiting... for a show that started too late and ended too soon.

3477296,male,Student,"                 Those of you who read the paper this morning (haha…andy doesn’t get the paper during the holidays) would’ve have seen the small article of the front page about bus drivers. You’re probably thinking “bus drivers, who cares, they are just the guys who get me to school” well this article is not just about bus drivers. It’s about giving bus drivers the power to remove students off buses for swearing, vandalism, spitting and just generally being uncooperative and unruly. The State Government drafted this law (or bill for all you commerce freaks) last night, probably out of boredom and thought this power would be useful to bus drivers.  &nbsp;  Ok, I will admit that us students can be a bit unruly at times, usually after either something really good or something really bad happens, but it’s like teenage human nature. The bus drivers and the public we travel with should know all about Generation X and how at this age our raging hormones causes random acts of unruliness and recklessness. I mean everybody goes through this faze of rebelliousness, even people as dull as bus drivers. I mean how times have your parents told you about all the crazy antics they got up to when they were young? I know my dad is always saying, “When I was your age, I had street fights everyday (yeah right) and I would always come home bruised with lots of cuts. Why aren’t you like that Wayne?” Well in this “civilized” society that governs us today, getting into street fights usually results in bruises and cuts as well as assault charges, lawsuits and probably juvenile detention. To avoid “juvey” us teenagers have to find someway to channel all that pent up energy our parents used to do crazy antics right? And what better way to do it than to be unruly on public transport?  &nbsp;  Everybody who catches the 651 in the afternoons would have at least experienced one of those times where the kids keep pressing the button and then the bus driver stops at the next stop and doesn’t move until someone gets off. Usually in these situations the kids win because after a while the bus moves without anybody gets off. Now bus drivers would think the students’ press the button to annoy him. This is true but only to a certain extent because we also push the button because we like that sound. In the society we live in we don’t here many bell sounds and the one of the bus is the only one we know of. Why can’t you bus drivers leave us bell-deprived kids alone?  &nbsp;  The State government should thank us kids as well because we are doing them a favour. We are conditioning the bus drivers. Pretty soon bus drivers on school buses just learn to block it all out, all the noise just becomes background. Because they are not listening to the noise they are more focused on their jobs, getting people from point A to point B. We are indirectly providing the government with highly focused, mentally strong bus drivers. Of course there are those who have a mental breakdown while driving a school bus, but just forget I mentioned them. The government should make it mandatory that trainee bus drivers have to do school routes for at least 6 months as part of their training.  &nbsp;  Fortunately for school students the Parent and Citizens Association does not want the bill to be passed because they say if you kick off a kid in the middle of nowhere (like Whoop Whoop for example), nowhere near other public transport services, then the child’s safety is in question. Students are stranded and unable to get home and they call their parents who get quite pissed off that they have to get to Whoop Whoop to get their kid. The PCA reckons bus drivers should not determine whether a situation is right or wrong, they should report any incidents to the school and let the school deal with it.  &nbsp;  School students do annoy bus drivers, but it’s for there own good, the same type of good that parents say you will thank them for later. Therefore bus drivers should not be able to kick off students. I rest my case.&nbsp; &nbsp;       "

Things to miss about Canada:  urlLink no pollution  (or not noticeable, at least); good mixed drinks (like Dr. Pepper and Long Island iced teas, although that's changing in Seoul now); our complex's pool just 5 minutes away (and it's usually just us or a few people there);  urlLink burgers that are not served raw   (hellloooooo! heard of e-coli?).  Things not to miss about Seoul: drunk guys pissing in the streets at night (well, I am one of them sometimes); people always thinking I'm crazy for not liking tofu; paying like $10 for enough ground beef for 2 hamburgers; having to go to the foreign food section to get my M&Ms.  Things not to miss about Canada: line-ups and cover charge at almost every good bar; larger Canadian chicks (hey, no flamings, please); union leaders who think someone should make $20 an hour to pick up trash when Korean 60-year-old men do it in Seoul for like $100 a month; Vancouver rain in the winter...and spring...and fall...and summer; high (14.5%!) sales  urlLink tax ; tips treated as if they are expected (no matter the service); having to go to the foreign food section to get my ramen noodles.

883178,male,Fashion,"            1. What's one thing you've always wanted to do, but never have?   Skydive.  Thats one.   2. When someone asks your opinion about a new haircut/outfit/etc, are you always honest?   Nope.  But I dont feel that Im all-out lying.  If someone gets a perm, I might not like it because I feel that its not my style, but I can appreciate that someone else might like it.  Therefore when I say it looks nice, Im really saying that someone must like it.  But maybe its just not my thing.   3. Have you ever found out something about a friend and then wished you hadn't? What happened?   Yes  many times.  There are many categories for this.  First off, there are the times that someone tells you something private or secret about another person, and you know that they shouldnt be telling you.  An example would be Jane told me her deepest secret  want to hear what it is??  and it kills you that this person actually tells you.  There are also the times that friends make decisions that you wouldnt make, and all you can do is support them and shut up.  Something like, Im going to invest in Worldcom - I would rather just not know about it.  Yet a third type is when you are told something that puts you in a dilemma  to tell or not tell.  I really dont like those.  Dont tell Jane, but her car is getting towed or Dont tell Jane, but Im about to sleep with her dad.  Alright, so car towing doesnt usually create a morality crisis, but you get the idea.  In case you cant tell, Im not a fan of secrets.  Ignorance is bliss.   4. If you could live in any fictional world (from a book/movie/game/etc.) which would it be and why?   I wouldnt mind being Buttercup in the Princess Bride.  Some pretty cool stuff happened in that book.     5. What's one talent/skill you don't have but always wanted?   I would love any kind of musical talent (take note, Bassy), be it singing, playing an instrument, conducting, or anything of the like.  Instead, I make mix tapes.          "
4192173,male,Technology,"             In between the new Hypefactor sessions (and until the new aggression remixes come in), my musical attention turns to Chemlab. Granted, my role at this point is cheerleader (and sounding board for Jared), but the focus is still on the music and giving my input towards making this the best possible Chemlab is a major priority. Being asked to work on this album has been like getting called up to the Majors after being in the Minor Leagues for a decade. Like Bull Durham (maybe). So I feel some pressure and I know, as my S.O. will attest, that this pressure is totally self-inflicted.   The newest round of Chem-mixes came my way today and the progress is shockingly good. I’m so impressed by what is coming out of Chicago. The Cracknation crew, as producers, have really stepped up to what could be their best produced album to date (The last ILC record being my favorite thus far). As a musician who has written and performed on the record, I am happy with the results. Also, I am satisfied that these songs and sutures appeal to the massive Chemlab fan I have been for most of my adult life.  Chemlab has a unique fanbase, and my concern is that regardless of how good the album is (and it’s REALLLLLLY good), the “kids” (as we call them) will still find fault with it because certain people are not involved or it doesn’t sound like 1994, etc. I’m shocked sometimes how hardcore fans of bands cannot accept musical evolution. I like evolution. I’m one of those people who likes Depeche Mode’s SONGS OF FAITH AND DEVOTION more than MUSIC FOR THE MASSES and U2’s ACHTUNG BABY more than THE UNFORGETTABLE FIRE (Robin will kill me for saying that). Growth is fun when it works like it did with those two Flood-Produced albums. Love and Rockets went dance, and went crap. The open-minded will love the new Chemlab. The fools stuck in 1994 can never ever be pleased.  F         "
3581210,male,InvestmentBanking,"             My wife posed a strange question to me tonight.  Apparently this is the new fad in Korea...men are asked 'if your wife and your mother are drowning (neither can swim) and you have time to save just one of them who would you choose?'.  Many men say, 'my mother, because I can always remarry...but I can never replace my mom.'  Ok, true enough, but usually its the wives who ask this and one fellow I know said, in front of a throng of relatives (including his wife) that he'd save his mom.  The wife was not impressed.  Let's look at this on a more cultural level for a moment.  Much of Korean tradition is based on Confucius' teachings; where younger take care of elder, women take care of men and duty to family is first.  Parents sacrifice a lot for their kids to get them the best education, lifestyle and necessities; children, in turn, are expected to do the same when they have the means.  Thus, a man should choose to save his mother, who did everything for him (and perhaps still does) rather than his wife who is a bit of a late-comer.  The reason for all of this ultimatum questioning comes from family conflict.  A husband's mother often endures a lot from her husband, children, society and her own mother-in-law and, not one to stop the cycle, she will often unleash her frustration on the unsuspecting wife.  She comes to pry into, advise upon and attempt to control many parts of the couple's lives under the guise of helping her dear son.  With divorce becoming more accepted and this has broken up more than a few marriages lately; and now people are getting a little pre-emptive, perhaps, in asking the husband to make a choice in order to ascertain his convictions.  So, men, if you get this question posed to you first think of who is asking it (probably your wife) take a look around the room to find out who is listening and then give the best answer you can.  Just remember, you likely sleep with your wife every night, not your mother.         "
3581210,male,InvestmentBanking,"             Korea is, as you may have guessed, a hyper-competitive place. Once a store, restaurant or whatever they always make a big deal of it. One of the best ways they have to get attention is dancing girls. Ya, you heard right. Girls in cheerleader-like outfits dancing up a storm to hiphop in front of a balloon arc and inflated animals of some sort. It's really quite a sight. When my cousin visited here last year we saw 2 or 3 of these things...his 20-year-old brain was probably about to overload. This display I saw in Namdaemoon as I did some light shopping (actually I needed more hankies as mine was soppign wet from the heat & humidity here these days). Have no idea what this store is, but I was sure tempted to take a look. (Guess the marketing works.)    urlLink      Welcome to the Grand Opening of...um...I forget...where am I anyways?    Then we have  urlLink Bricx , a little place I've walked past but didn't see a reason to enter...maybe now, however.    urlLink      I'm not one for anime usually, but this one...    It took me a while to read it correctly. Usually they say things like 'free drinks (upon paying cover of 20,000 won)' or something. I know  urlLink Ohoo/Hodge Podge  has free drinks for ladies on Thursdays from 10-midnight, but this one is a little more interesting. All gals in bikini tops get free drinks at Bricx on that night...hmmmm. I wonder what they'd do if I showed up in my bro/manzeer.   Finally, take a look at  urlLink Seoul Pub's  video on  urlLink 'Picking up in Seoul'  on  urlLink Seoul Scene's website . It's pretty corny...but mostly funny. The Aussie in the rugby jersey is a regular there (I mean like every night, which is probably why he's featured so prominently).&nbsp; They've got another one called  urlLink Bondaegi Challenge  in which unsuspecting passer-bys are asked to eat....ready for this?...steamed silkworm larvae.

4192173,male,Technology,"             So while arranging the song B, Ash, Robin and Charles wrote, DESCRIPTIVE, we paused to eat some Great Wall and watch the Season Finale of 24, which was really good. Not great, but really good. Jack's breakdown at the end was a good way to end it. The War goes on and Jack Bauer will not tire! Anyhow, The show's not back on till January and I have a feeling it will be a very different show. Seasons 1 and 2 were classic and quite frankly, Season 3 had a lot to live up to and occasionally delivered. It's time to change up the formula. However, speaking of season finale's, SMALLVILLE was awesome and they re really shaking up that show in a good way. They got rid of a lot of characters supposedly and had a well crafted cliffhanger. Kudo's to that writing staff.  I took a quiz that was called 'Which 24 Character are you most like' and this was the answer: 'You are MOST like JACK BAUER. Your motives are pure, but your tactics are ruthless, fearless and uncompromising. You value loyalty, honour and tradition. You don't trust people easily, but when they do earn your trust, you are loyal to them, sometimes to a fault. You are quick-witted, resourceful and a bit of a badass. You love danger and taking risks, but will not hesitate to put yourself on the line for your beliefs and the people you care about.'  I think i AM a bit of a badass, though I hope I don't have a heroin habit by next season.  As for the new song, it's damn good and the kids have left me a lot to work with. I don't know if they will love the arrangement, but you can't make everyone happy. I already have vocal melodies for it. It gets quite electronic in the middle, which I love. It will be great for the single.It needs some more meat on it, though I'm not sure what it needs yet or if even I'm the man to do it. Regardless, this track is certainly worthy of the HF catalogue. My compatriots are a mean force.  Meanwhile, Brandt gave me a new edit of CREATION PHASE where the intro was significantly chopped. The song has much more punch now, which really takes it over the top (a good thing). it makes sense. Also, he recorded some extra guitars for LENINGRAD, which were good but needed proper placement, so we spent sometime on that. Now that song's just about perfect.   Brandt will now be spending the next week plus editing drums. Closer and Closer. We need to be careful not to start overthinking shit.   While I am a newcomer to THE SOPRANO's, my love for Drea De Matteo is everlasting. Watching her get beat up and now supposedly killed on that show is too much for me.

4192173,male,Technology,"             En route back to NY finally. Because this LA trip was so hastily put together, I flew out of Long Beach, which is a timewarp to the old tiny airports of the past. Think CATCH ME IF YOU CAN with high tech security and you get what I’m saying. Even had to walk out to the tarmac to get on the plane. LOVE that (see previous Iceland/UK 2001 photos). Flying Jet Blue for the first time. It’s quite humourous. They have Direct TV on the flight, with about 15 channels. Of course one of them has to be VH1 Classics and I am immediately drawn to the Power Station’s SOME LIKE IT HOT. Speaking of which…  I’m obviously doing something right as the Durans have decided to play a club show at Webster Hall, which is 7 blocks away from us. And when are they playing? August 27th, my birthday. Now all I need are tickets.  Agent/Lawyer/Advisor and I went to check out 16 Volt the other night in LA. Well, we tried to. Because she was late to dinner, thus making me and former aggression vocalist turned important screenwriter wait forever to eat, we showed up at the venue at about 9:45. Eric Volt was kind of enough to guest list me, and his website and the ticketmaster site said “9pm” on it, so we expected to sit through some opening acts. At the door, the start times were listed and it read “16Volt 9:00-9:35” (or something like that). Um, WHAT?

883178,male,Fashion,"           I am growing a beard.  It will meet its premature end on Sunday night.  I like beards.  Left to my own devices, I would have one all the time.  Why? Because I like them.  Also, they are much easy than shaving, and I don't have to worry about ingrown hairs, razor burn, etc.  I also think that I look a wee bit better with a beard than without.  That's just my opinion.    Beards are not doing well in America these days.  It has been the case for a long time.  Mustaches are fine.  Goatees are de riguer, but beards for some reason are not favored.  I don't know if it is because of a tie to fundamentalists, or mountain men, or what.  I do know that the company I work for has a policy against beards.  This always amazes me.  No other hair policy exists.  Theoretically, I could come in sportin' braids, but I should shave.  I could dye my hair blond, but I better come in with a hairless chin.    My boss is not much for beards either.  I could tell by the way he looked at me when he first saw me this week.    Mrs. Duf hates a beard with the best of them.  Which is, of course, encouragement in the other direction.    I once saw a 60 minutes piece where Ed Bradley was profiled in an airport because he bought a ticket the day of a flight, was black, paid cash and...that's right...had a beard.    It just seems odd to me that multiple Presidents have had beards.  Jesus had a beard, and so did the entire Allman Brothers band.  Yet for some reason, they are frowned upon.  So here's my plan: as soon as I retire, I'm growing it out.  Big, bad and beautiful.  Just like nature intended.           "

589736,male,Technology,"           Damn!  Has it really been three weeks since I last posted?  As the RTG people know, Julie was readmitted to the hospital a couple of weeks ago.  Her test results last week were positive, which, in this case is a bad thing.  The latest ray of hope is that the doctor will re-run the test tomorrow to rule out a false positive.  If it comes back negative, Julie will probably come home.  If it comes back positive, she still might, but her OB and the twin specialist will have to come to an agreement.  At this point, she is 30 weeks, and the doctors ideally want her to 'hold out' (like any of this is up to her) until 34 weeks.  In the meantime I am still doing my juggling act balancing work, the house, my daughter, and visiting Julie. Is sleep necessary?  Everyone please think NEGATIVE!

2821801,female,indUnk,"           [Jacked from my post on the  urlLink R6 Message Net  - you can see responses there.]  Well, on valued recommendations I went out and bought two games for my computer last night.  I thought I was getting tired of diablo2, so figured some variety would help.  I purchased 'never winter nights gold' and 'unreal2' - for about $50 total (combined).  Let me just say, both suck my sweaty nuts. I expected the FPS to be a little easier (b/c it's made for retarded ADD children) - but it was just boring, and very stupid. Doesn't seem much has changed since the days of 'Doom' and 'Duke Nukem'.  Neverwinter nights is kind of a D&D game - so I expected strategy etc - it took me an hour to make my character. So, after I make my character (Boofy McBoofersen) I try to play the fucking game (you know, the reason I BOUGHT IT) - and I have to sit through fucking 45 minutes of bullshit text, and talk to 50,000 people, 50,000 times each, before I get to go kill shit. Then, what happens, I walk outside to try and kill a dog or the first thing I see - the GUI has about 10,000 options and I think a chicken killed me while I was trying to figure out wtf to do.  So, folks, save your fuckin money. I'm writing this off as a learning experience.  Needless to say, I'm pretty disappointed in these games.  I tried again, today, to play U2 - I got about 5 minutes in and said 'fuck this'.  So, if anyone wants to buy either or both of these off me, let me know.         "

4192173,male,Technology,"             Quick Pit Stop in the studio yesterday for some bass overdubs and retracking some older parts to fit the current scheme of things. Quite frankly, it was too nice out to sit in the studio too long. We did some stuff, fixed some tracks and went CD shopping at Rebel Rebel. Of course we spent too much money (Brandt in particular), but it was worth the hit as the purchases between both of us (new UNKLE, Hybrid featuring Peter Hook, and Muse's new one) were all winners and now blasting loud on the Ipod.  The vision for the rest of the album becomes clearer. A track written in the aggression camp might defect to HF2 if I can get Ash to sign off on it. If so, we're going into Primals territory.

589736,male,Technology,"           I have not seen the movie, and really had no intention to, but Julie wants to rent it on DVD, so we will rent it at some point.  My reason for not seeing had nothing to do with marketing or what studio produced it.  Since March of 2000, when my daughter was born, our movie watching has dropped dramatically.  Where we used to go to the movies at least every other week, it is know at most one every other month.  From memory, the movies we saw last year were Castaway, Blackhawk Down, SW:II, MIB:II, and Two Towers.  So far this year, we have seen Chicago.  So, that being said, Greek Wedding did not make it onto my extremely short list.  This is not meant to offend or insult anyone, but I find it funny that a film that was aparently not good enough for any of the major studios and became such a mainstream success as an independent film, is disliked by the people who usually like the independent films.  It kind of reminds me of what happened to U2 when most of us were in high school (and Angie still thought boys were gross).  They were liked by a few people (Ben being the one the comes to my mind), and then they got, gasp, popular, and all the people who liked them first suddenly did not want to listen to them.  Johnathan and I have pretty divergent tastes in movies.  Not necessarily in genres, but in what we find enjoyable.  I go to the movie for a couple of hours of escapism, and will usually only have problems with a film because it drags or has gaping plot holes.  From my perspective, Johnathan goes to the movies to see a well produced movie, with a solid plot.  He does not seem to be impressed with eye candy, but more so with the finer details of the film (what kind of lighting, hard vs. soft focus, camera angles, etc).  I, as a fairly mindless member of the general herd, don't notice those things unless they interfere with my enjoyment of the movie.  My general rule is that if the critics love a movie, I don't want to see it.  I have been burned too many times seeing critically aclaimed movies.  As for Jennifer's question about furniture, I have lived in Richmond for 25 years now, and have never heard of the store in question.  Now, it sounds like they make very nice, and assumed to be expensive, furniture.  I don't want to buy something for my house that I will be afraid to use because it might be damaged, especially now with three munchkins cruising around armed with juice and crayons.  So, I will buy stuff from Haynes (at one of their 'best sales ever') accepting that it is not as nice, and almost certainly will not last as long, but then be able to replace it when it wears out, and probably be able to still spend less than a nicer store.

3869393,female,Technology,"       Relations......  These days, we are speaking aboutInternational Relations, Customer Relations, ClientRelations, Employee Relations and in fact, Across theBorder Relations. All, the above relations aremonetary in nature and none of them is without anypurpose.  The philosophy is very simple, Give and Take.In the process, we are forgetting/ignoring ourpersonal relations, family relations and General HumanRelations, relations, which are based on values, love,affection and care.  You may call it as an influence of western culture orlack of time or self-fish nature of a person...we approach or remember our friends, relatives andsometimes even our parents...only at the time of need.There is no trust, no faith, no believe, no loyaltyand no love in relations.   Generally, whenever I extendmy hand for friendship, I face two types of queries from other people.  1)I don't know anything about you I am not interested? True, I don't know anything about you but does that stop you or me to know about each other. Relations,need time...in fact quality time.  2)What do you want from me? This is because, we knowthat nothing comes free and if some one is approaching you, it is only for some purpose. We believe that noone will be approaching you, without anypurpose...there is no self less relation. Probably yes, but I can assure you that I don't need you oryour help, I like to know about you, your values, yourbelieves, to understand you as a person...andprobably, I may be able to help you...sometimes...downin my life time.  I believe in two things:  1)Learning from other's experience  2)Every Person is Different  A child is born with numerous relations'...relations of parents, grandparents, relatives and what not. Why we are so poor in maintaining our relations? We are selfish, we are opportunistic, we never feel happy inthe happiness of others, we never celebrate otherssuccess and most importantly, we have doublestandards.  It is pathetic to know and read news like,' Son murdering his mother or a father raping his daughter', these are the foundation of any relation...and if that foundation itself is so weak,what can we expect from other relations. Where are those values and culture, we are so proud off?  The question is very simple, if you are not able to maintain your relations with your parents, your children, your relatives and yourfriends, which are lesser in number and known to you;how are you going to maintain your relations with employees, which are larger in number and not known to you?

3647746,male,Education,"           In September of 1996, I was backpacking through Israel when I landed in the northern hill town of Tzfat (AKA Safed).  Tzfat is the epicenter of Jewish mysticism and has become a...wait for it...Mecca for people interested in living a thoroughly Jewish life, complete with exhaustive ritual and worship, but with a focus on the more esoteric teachings of  urlLink Kabbalah , rather than the more literal Judaism prevelent in Jerusalem.  Often, people arrive in Tzfat wanting to merely dabble, but end up moving there and dramatically changing their lives.  For lodging I stayed at a hostel run by an Orthodox Jewish organization providing free shelter in exchange for attendance at religious education classes held several times a day.  It's no secret that many Jewish tourists traveling around Israel have a sometimes hidden (sometimes not) agenda to have some kind of religious or spiritual experience while in the Holy Land, especially Jews from the U.S. where spirituality is mostly marginalized.  After all, when you return from a trip to Israel, you will invariably be asked by many people whether or not anything happened, and by the way the question is formed, you know they're not asking whether or not you got sick from eating too many dates.    In Tzfat, something happened, but I've only recently figured out what it was.  I had already been through Jerusalem and had prayed at the holiest Jewish site in the world, the  urlLink Western Wall , the remnants of the Holy Temple destroyed by the Romans in 68 C.E.  While it was indeed an incredible place to visit, and while I did feel the weight of history and the echoes of millions of prayers thick in the air, I came away feeling like something was missing, as if I was supposed to have had a catharsis or awakening.  Indeed, nothing so dramatic happened during my entire visit.  And so I came to Tzfat a bit let down, but not without hope that I'd pick up something of spiritual value.  It was in that spirit that I attended a morning class with a Rabbi whose name, sadly, never stuck with me.    We spent the entire hour talking about the first line of the Book of Genesis.  Well, at least the Rabbi tried to contain the discussion to the first line, quoting commentary written over hundreds of years, analyzing every word in that first sentence.  Every word, of course, had numerous possible meanings as there is a great deal of interpretation that comes with translating from Hebrew.  So, I thought this level of scrutiny was a green light for me to ask a question about the rest of the creation story, a question that had bugged me for years.   hjm: Rabbi, do you really believe that heaven and earth were created in 6 days?  Six days as we know them now?  Six twenty-four hour days?  Rabbi: Yes, I do.    hjm: What about modern interpretations that suggest the possibility that each of those 6 days actually lasted millions of years?  Rabbi: No. They were twenty-four hour days, just as we experience them today.  hjm: So, you actually believe that is has only been 5,755 years since heaven and earth were created.  Rabbi: Yes.  hjm: What about science?  What about carbon date testing that shows fossils to be millions of years old?  Rabbi:  Scientists believe what they want to believe, and I believe what I want to believe.   On the surface, there was nothing remarkable about this Rabbi.  He wore the traditional black and white clothes, his hair and beard were characteristically unkempt, he was probably not that much older than me, but he'd forgotten more about Judaism than I had ever learned.  In hindsight, what I realize now as significant was the utter sincerity, the quiet conviction, the peacefulness he exuded, comforted by his faith and under no pressure whatsoever to justify it to anyone.  Sure, he taught the classes in hopes that others might share the rewards of his faith.  Yet, he had no desire to force his views on anyone.    So, it strikes me how different he was from other people I have met who profess a deep, passionate faith.  It has been my misfortune to have more than once been confronted by religious zealotry, an entirely different practice in faith with a very different presentation.  The zealot seems driven more by desperation than anything else.  They have seen the light and operate from a place of panic, feeling that they are personally responsible for the salvation of others.    For years after my trip, I liked to tell the story about that Rabbi, and it is with some degree of shame that I realize that I actually took delight in pointing out what, until now, seemed like the worst kind of blind faith, the shunning of fundamental scientific discoveries in favor of a literal interpretation of a document, The Bible, that scientists and scholars have made few solid conclusions about.  I got a lot of mileage with that anecdote and missed the point completely.  In the end, it was more important that the Rabbi was benevolent than whether or not he was right about the origins of the universe.  One can have all the faith in the world, but if he/she does not practice tolerance towards fellow humans who have their own version of faith, if they are motivated by desperation rather than love, then not only are they are in no position to be prosletyzing, but they are hardly models of an enlightened being, totally incapable of demonstrating the benefits of faith.

649790,female,indUnk,"               Bel's B'day  I spent yesterday and today with Bel, celebrating her 22nd birthday. It was very enjoyable - yesterday we had a picnic at Fitzroy Gardens, with E-Gene. I got her a picnic lunch for her b'day (sigh, which I still feel is a kinda cheapo prezzie...) and also baked a cake. We had sandwiches, potato gems, crackers with kabana sausages and tasty cheese, herb and garlic cheese spread, strawberries and apples, and coke to wash it down. Throughly enjoyable, and the company was good :-)  Today we went to South Melbourne beach - took the tram down. We spent a couple of hours on the sand, talking about stuff, from relationships to people to school. Then had tea at a cafe and talked some more. Then had dinner with people from her church - mostly her housemate, Jean's friends, one of whom I found out much later was Wally's housemate! Wow...hehe. Dinner was fun, at this place called Malaya Inn in Doncaster - nice yummy food like  Or Jian  (fried oyster omelette), fish head curry, sambal kangkong etc. And even bowls of chicken soup! Mmmmm... It was followed by coffee at Brunetti's, which I hadn't been to since it's renovation. Didn't stay long though, 'coz Charles n EG came to pick me up soon, after their dinner and M1 concert.  The people I met today seemed really nice - would like to hang out more with them if I could. Nice to get to know new people. I'm also beginning to hang out more with a bunch of people from church, which is great (and a long time coming, considering I've been at ACCF for more than a year). Guess I'm finally fitting in and finally finding my place in the scheme of things - esp. 'coz of Alpha.  Btw, I've graduated from Alpha course on Wednesday, with my own certificate and everything! Alpha is sorta a back-to-basics course in Christianity, which EG and I attended, and after many months, finally finished it off reinforcing the knowledge we have, and making many new friends!  Anyways, back to today. I'd wanted to bring my camera and take lotsa pics, so that I could stick it into an album or collage for Bel to remember, but ARGHFFF!!! Forgot the camera!! Sigh...sad right? There goes a nice prezzie idea...  Chatting with Bel was nice. It's interesting how our friendship had evolved - I never really liked her from the start (which she tells me is what happens with practically every girl she meets - they automatically don't like her for some reason, so poor thing right? She says sometimes she acts a lil' bimbotic, just to seem more affable to people, 'coz she's naturally assertive. Me, I don't have that problem - I'm naturally bimbotic! heheheh). I didn't like her then 'coz I must admit I was a lil' intimidated by her, 'coz she's quite confident and assertive (and also very babe hehe, which I still think so), plus her manner wasn't very, I dunno, warm n friendly? A little aloof sometimes, and when she was friendly, she seemed superficial, and very PR. Plus we didn't have much in common to talk about too.   But we get along better now, and talk about stuff. She made a good point, that we should try to hang out when we're both in S'pore, or it'll seem like we just hang out with each other here and now 'coz we don't have any other close girlfriends here. Thinking about it, it's partly true though, 'coz Bel and I aren't exactly personality matches in a way - but that's 'coz our friendship is still progressing. Let me explain.  I personally think everyone has friendships with others on different levels. Like how I interact with people like say Charles, or Velle and Priyanca, is different how I interact with Bart, is different from how I interact with Bel, different from how I interact with my housemates, and different for EG (of course). With the first category, and also with my housemate Evie, I'm a lil' crazier and silly, and loonier . But when I'm with EG or Shawn, a lil' less loony and loud ('coz EG keeps telling me I'm too loud), with Bart I'm more affectionate, and with Bel I'm more sedate, 'coz we're still establishing our friendship, and haven't come to that super-comfortable point yet. I think the true litmus test will be to see her reaction to one of my Silly Songs! Then I'l know...hehehe            "

I decided to pick up knitting again this weekend and have so far knitted 2 scarves and begun three more.  I'm obsessed.  I even raced after school to a knitting store that closes at four so that I could buy way too much yarn for half price.  But, at least my friends will nice have nice yarn in their scarves instead of the Walmart brands.  I want to constantly be knitting.  I've even started knitting in bed with no lights on.  That's right, knitting in the dark, sexy.  And yesterday, I had to refrain from taking the knitting to the bathroom with me.  Knitting is on the brain so much that it's all I think about (at least for the last few days).  Like, when I'm at work or out with friends I keep thining 'I really wish I had my knitting right now.  I really want to finish that scarf.'  It's like I need a bumper sticker that says I'D RATHER BE KNITTING.  And no, there is no purling, just kniting and knitting and knitting.  See the obsession, it's bad and well, I need to get back to the needles and the yarn.   Tonight was yet another wedding related event, a surprise semi-shower for the friend and co-teacher.

883178,male,Fashion,"           Speaking of freakish neighbors...I have a few of my own.  In the last 6 months, my apartment management company opened up our building to dog-owners.  Now don't get me wrong - I'm completely pro dog.  But when you put a massive dog like a rottweiler in a studio apartment, terrible things are bound to happen...things that make me want to strangle the mutts.  Take for instance the Spanish-speaking woman (I will call her Lola)  two  doors down from me.  I no longer need an alarm clock.  Lola leaves at 7:30 sharp every morning.  That happens to be the time I get up for work.  That also happens to be the time the dog becomes possessed by the devil.  I have no desire to find out if its bark is worse than its bite.  I'm convinced the dog has been trained to kill...he  screams  when Lola leaves.  I've already left one complaint to our management company and my neighbor right next to me (let's call her Bonnie) has left 4 complaints.  Last night Bonnie knocked on my door.  She said Lola has now complained about HER to our landlord...Lola's mad because she said Bonnie has been knocking on her door and harassing her (Of course Bonnie had just wanted to tell Lola to shut up her dog, and Lola never even answered the door.)  I told Bonnie I would be happy to vouch for her that Lola's dog is a complete menace.  Bonnie then informed me she's in law school and '[Lola] has made the wrong person mad.'  Whatever.  Then there are these 2 dudes (I call them dudes because to call them 'men' would be laughable) across the hall from me.  They both look like Jay of Silent Bob & Jay fame and they listen to old Pearl Jam albums all day long.  (How do these people afford rent?)  Seems rather appropriate since they are living in the apartment that Bill, the former resident and local drug dealer, lived.  (Refer to Pandyland archives.)  They have a huge dog as well - I'd call it a mix between a boxer and a rottweiler.  Mean, mean, mean.  He sniffed my butt the other day.  Now I'm getting sexually harassed by a dog.  Great.  Just another reason I can't wait to find a job and get the heck out of Chi-town.  Maybe I could do what this one guy on Michigan Ave was doing the other day.  He was all dressed up in a snow suit, and looked relatively normal.  Except for the fact he was carrying skis, wearing ski boots, and holding a 'Keystone, Colorado or BUST!' sign and a bucket to gather donations.  Wow, he must  really  like to ski.          "

There a little hard to come by in Downtown Miami, and I asked her to send me one.  'Why?' you ask. *while thinking I'm a little strange, too*  I've been reading a great book called 'Teachings of Love' by this amazing Vietnamese Buddhist Monk *my strangeness reveals itself*.  In one chapter, he discusses how we are a part of our family and our family is a part of us.  Sometimes, when we stand apart from our family (especially here in the West), we can become confused.  We can suffer like a tree that has become uprooted when we sever the roots of our family.    And that's me in a nutshell.  Family has been a collection of people that had very little to do with who I am and what I am.  Then I realized that's not true.  While I'm not a branch or a flower on the tree, I am still part of that family tree.  I'm a pinecone.  I've left the tree, but its still in me, made me who I am, and I am still part of the tree.  I'm a pinecone, taking the nature of that family with me, and growing my own roots somewhere else.  Continuing my family with a family of my own.  So today, I asked my mom to send me a pinecone as a reminder of who I am.  I tried explaining it to her.  I'm sure she thinks I'm strange.

She was freaked and gave me his number to try to tlk him into leaving her alone... so i tried to talk to him, but after we spoke he fell in love with me!

So i give di JP's number and they spoke on the phone... and it happened again... he fell in love with Di(this happened ova a period of 4 days).

He would tell us stories about his sex life and his fantasies about us (believe me its too graphic to describe!!!) Roxy started feeling really uncomfortable and so decided to get rid of him... so she told JP that she was a lesbian (not true!). But then he simply said that whenever she felt like it, she should come with her gf and they cud all get freaky together!  Then he foned me and asked me if it was true about Roxy being gay... so i said 'nope she jst doesnt wana speak to u, we all think u are a freak' So he told me that he really liked me and wanted to know if i would get freaky with him, so i got pissed and i told him i had a boyfriend and then i hung up the fone.  Then he decided to fone di... He told di that he loved her. So di said, 'FUCK OFF! we do not want u go get urself a desparate gf like urself.' He then said, ' i'll get u guys i swear!' Kinda like a horror movie (everything here did happen).  So Jp stopped calling us for like 2 weeks. Then one day my landline rang, i picked up the fone and guess who was at the end... JP!.

So i screamed and told him to never fone me again... he let out a horny moan and the line went dead. Then it hit me, I realised that i had never given JP my landline number.  After a while Roxy foned and told me JP had called on her house fone aswell. So we waited for di to fone and tell us that Jp foned her, bt suprisinly he hadnt. He did not fone us for like 3 weeks, bt he kept on calling di and leaving wierd messages on her fone. He had finally gotten ova us bt not ova di. So diana decided to get a new fone that way he wudnt have her number. Oh well, strange things do happen and he jst stopped calling. Anyways at the end of march he sent us a message saying he got a gf! Its not like we care, bt we feel srry for whoeva is going out with him, shes probably jst blind and as desparate.  This is a true story! PEACE!       "
2012853,female,indUnk,"       Does this count as a hobby?   I have decided, that I am going to become a person who has many hobbies. I've been feeling a little 2-D lately, partly cause a new friend asked me if I had an online journal, and i thought I did but after visiting his mine seems so.. well, 2D. I don't know if I want to show this to him.... his site was pretty good, it had all the interests and recent things that had happened to him.. and it got me thinking, what are my interests? what are my hobbies? I guess I just never thought about it before.  That may sound sad,  but when I asked my brother if he thought I had any hobbies, he flatly replied,  'your hobbies are friends and work'.  ahem.  Boring!! There's so much to me than that! Isn't there?  Music, concerts, Books, Games, AND friends and work i guess.  Well i guess going to concerts was a bit of a habit last year, and i'm sure it will be too this year. Last year I saw Groove Armada, John Mayer, Michelle Branch and (not really my choice but circumstancial attendance)  Prince, Shaggy and Craig David.  I guess thats somewhat attached to work though, so does that make it a hobby still??   And i went to tropfest last week, which was excellent!! it was a big thing in the domain where they showed short films and everyone brought picnics with wine, cheese, and other miscellaneous picnic food. It was great, lounging around watching the short films.. great stuff.  So I guess I do have hobbies,  and interests, just don't have a site about it.            "

649790,female,indUnk,"              Nice...  Had a nice day today, hanging out with Charles watching The Banger Sisters, and then having dinner and a date with EG.   I was bugging him after dinner to 'be spontaneous' and to 'go somewhere', like the beach or something. 'Coz we never really do anything like that, or go out on dates anymore - usually if it's just the 2 of us it's just running errands together or something. So yeah, had a nice time at St.Kilda Beach, and at the cafe at the end of the pier. We talked and laughed and joked around, and generally had a great time.   Anyways, major event. EG found my keys! We initially thot he'd lost it, and we'd have to cough up money to get a new one requested from the Body Corporate, 'coz it's a security key. But wot a miracle! See, he's been in and out of his car countless times since yesterday night, when he'd thought he'd lost it. He'd driven to church to search, to the post office, and today he drove to church, reparked the car etc. All in all, he was in the car MANY MANY times. And today, after work at the church office, there it was, lying on the seat, in broad daylight, as if someone had just placed it there! Freaky, no? Either someone had somehow gotten into his car, taken the key, made a copy or something, and placed it back there (without stealing the car or breaking any windows...), or a miracle was at work. Touched by an angel eh? They must've been watching.  In other news, got the Bic Runga CD, Beautiful Collision today at JB HiFi, for $18!! Can u imagine? I'd wanted to buy it earlier, so good thing I didn't. I was even in JB HiFi yesterday, but just bought the Killing Heidi album (which I'm really enjoying rite now), figuring since I had an online voucher I could use for the CD. That didn't work out, which was just as well, 'coz today was the start of the JB HiFi Christmas sale! Can anybody say woohooo?  *wooohooo* (echo...echo...echo....)

883178,male,Fashion,"           Greetings from So-Cal.  Writing to you cordless!!  Im here for some meetings and theyve been fine.  Tonight the real entertainment began at our celebration dinner to celebrate a less than successful rollout, but it would be bad to not have the dinner that usually follows such rollouts, so whatever.  A certain celebrant decided that celebration dinner translates in idiot as you should be drunk.  Examples include when we had ordered our own desserts and then he said bring out another 3 or 4 tiramisus to share.  Uh, there were only 9 of us, and we had all just ordered what we wanted.  Throughout dinner, when someone finished their drink, he would order another one for them.  They wouldnt know it till another (unwanted) new drink appeared in front of them.  My boss (a vegan) joined the table only to have him helpfully point her our to the waiter by yelling, SHES THE VEGAN.  Im sure the other patrons appreciated this info.   After dinner, a bottle of Veuve Clicquot appeared, and he yelled THIS IS ON ME, THIS IS A CELEBRATION FOR CRISSAKES!  I LIKE TO LIVE LIFE.  Uh, okay but the best was at the very end, when a few people had filtered out.  He cornered the two business sponsors and resident corporate bigwigs and told them I DONT UNDERSTAND OUR BUSINESS MODEL  IT IS GOING TO FAIL.  I KNOW THE BROKERAGE INDUSTRY LIKE THE BACK OF MY HAND, AND WERE GOING TO FAIL.  Mind you, were not in the brokerage industry  Cue exit of everyone with the exception of Mr. My-resignation-is-forthcoming we left him at the restaurant as he told us I JUST SAW MY FRIEND  HE WANTS TO FINISH THE BOTTLE WITH ME  We re-convene tomorrow morning at 8am.  Hope he makes it.          "

3894385,male,indUnk,             In the midst of a good day i recive a letter in the mail informing me that i've been cut from the high school baseball team due to missing the entire offsesson which really pissed my coach off. So all i have left right now is cross country which somtimes i resent because the runners are all skinny and jealous of my muscles. My dad didn't care because he says that running can get me more places than baseball can. I think that is bullshit but everybody has their opinions so why should i get upset? Anyways i have to try out for baseball again but i don't think the coach will give me another chance at it so i probably just going to stick with my select team because i have a better chance of getting into college with this team than the high school team. We play Carrol in an exhibition game at Pittman. They'll be preaty easy but not that easy. Moody kicked our ass but King fell mercifully when i hit that double that brought in 2 runsso in other words we beat them not very badly but badly. So fall ball is approaching and the start of my select team's offseason is near so i probably won't be writing in here occasinally so PEACE!

4192173,male,Technology,"             Sorry it has been some time since I posted last, but an attempted graduation and HF2 have swamped me for the past few months. Consider this a bid to be a bit more disciplined, as there will be a lot to say in the next few months, and not all of it about factor.  Speaking of...  Yesterday Robinowitz, F and I spent the evening on Long Island (out of necessity, not choice) for what will be our second-to-last session of live drum recording. Ash dropped off the gear, made a run to Wendy's and trashed some '80s music before taking his leave, although we begged him to stay. After a whirlwind setup, we tackled four tunes: 'The Morning After The Life Before,' 'Our Faith,' 'Theme From Propaganda' and 'Leningrad' (formerly known as 'Two Basses,' and there's a free drink at KGB in it for anyone who can figure out the origin of the new title.)  F wrote extensively here about the devolution of our earliest drum sessions into logistical nightmares, the worst of which was the electrical blaze that temporarily retired Ash's mixing desk. Honestly, the first five or six sessions were total pains in the ass, between moving gear out to Long Island, moving  ourselves  out to Long Island, scheduling idiocy, incompetent parts suppliers and missing gear.   But yesterday's session (and the two previous - one with Ash and Robin and one with Robin alone) was, in a word, effortless. For the first time, we made it through the full schedule of songs for the evening (with time to spare for homemade biscuits.) Robin's playing was spot-on; I spent this morning at the Cage listening to her playing without any EQ or compression, and it was striking to hear how few edits would be required on the tracks. 'Theme From Propaganda' is now a storming funk tune - house music played by a live band (which just might be disco, right?) - while 'Leningrad' is Gustavo Cerati's Ocio project playing folk music. Nice stuff.  'Creation Phase' is undergoing a major overhaul at the moment thanks to prodding from Robin and Ash, although it probably will not be complete until well into April. During a tracking session for this tune and 'Solar' in mid-February, we ran into problems with a rhythm arrangement for the bridge, and Robin and Ash basically said the song's second half was shit. I do not always agree with Ash, but he was dead-on right; I'd had reservations about the bridge for some time myself, and they validated that. The next week Robin and I tracked a drum part for the 'new' bridge that, when complete, will mark the first time this band has written around the drummer, rather than loops. When this tune emerges from maintenance, expect it to be leaner and meaner. The meanest song on the LP, in fact, when F's vocals are complete.  A slew of gigs are coming up that I am hoping will be brilliant: Death Cab For Cutie at Irving Plaza, Squarepusher at Irving and The Rapture and Black Rebel Motorcycle Club in a double headlining bill at Roseland. And, were that not exciting enough, The Twilight Singers return for a Warsaw gig at the beginning of April. More on that later.  I know this is a few weeks late, but...

So much to get done! And so many people to liaise with.  Sometimes, I wonder if it's just easier to  NOT  work with people, especially when u have to push, cajole, beg to ask them to get things done. I hate doing it, hate being the middleman. I want the Vision to inspire people enough that they're clamouring to get it done, to support what we're planning, but those darn  exams  just get in the way!!  Planning a wedding, on the flipside, seems to generate much more excitement. Most people ar ecstatic to be invited to be part of the intimate undertakings of planning a wedding! And I fully understand why - it's like being a part of a secret sorority that creates something beautiful, and once-in-a-lifetime chance! And I'm so terribly honoured and grateful that my friends have jumped at the chance to assist and be a part of something that holds so much meaning to me.   I guess I just wish that that sort of excitement could be generated in everything I need help to do! Is it really how well I have to cast a Vision that'll inspire others to move out of their comfort zones? Sometimes even I don't want to move out of the zone myself, to do above and beyond what's just required of me. I mean it's not like I need/want others to do the tasks - but really the sense of delegation-as-empowerment. As in 'teach them how to fish, and they can fish for a lifetime', that kinda philosophy! (But of course, there are instances where my skills are sorely deprived in departments of creative design, graphics and layout, and I have to depend on others.)  As you can tell I'm ranting. Lord, I ask for wisdom and strength and calmness in times like these! Teach me to be more like you! Less Self, more You!!  Father, I need your supreme wisdom, patience and kindness to fill my every thought and deed. Let me not be so tired that I forget how to see others as images of You!          "

766556,female,indUnk,"        The Glamorous Life?   I live in Downtown Miami, in the lap of luxury... on the 25th floor with a balcony overlooking Miami and the Beaches.  I have a f-a-a-a-a-bulous view of Biscayne Bay and the Ocean -- way over there on the horizon.  Miami is beautiful and draws all the beautiful people.  Movies are made, videos are shot and we are all dripping with glamour.  There are advantages to being a Downtown Diva.  With that in mind, let me tell you about last Friday night.  A production company has been filming 'Fast and Furious 2' for months now, in and around Miami.  They've been filming in my 'hood for the past few weeks.  Yes, glamorous.  Glitzy and fabulous.  Haven't actually seen that yummy Diesel guy, but he's hangin' in my 'hood for filming.    And, last Friday they were filming until the wee hours of the morning - actually they didn't even start until 11pm.  How do I know this, you ask?  I know this because that's when I was going to sleep - or at least I thought I was.  At about 11:30, while falling deep into peaceful slumber, I was violently and rudely awakened by screaming police sirens and screeching tires.  Now, I'm used to sirens in the middle of the night - after all, it is Downtown - but not at this high volume.   After my heart began to beat again, I got up and went out onto my terrace to see what all the commotion was.  It was Fast and Furious 2.  They had closed of the entire 4 blocks of the street one block over for this scene, which apparently involves a high speed police chase outside a strip club.    Also, apparently, they didn't get it right the first time and had to re-shoot the scene around 2am - sirens and tires and all.   So, when you go see this movie (sometime next year probably) and you get to the scene outside a really colorful strip club with a green entrance, know that you're in my 'hood.  And when you hear the screaming sirens and the screeching tires, remember your Diva being ripped from her slumber at 2am when they shot that damn thing!  Ah, the glamourous life.   Diva out.

3022585,female,Education,"       How do we meet them?  When do we know they will be important in our lives?  What are the signs that certain people are meant to change you, permanently?    This weekend I found a good friend, and luckily, she is part of my family.  At our mutual cousin's wedding we met again after probably 15 years.  I don't even remember the last time I saw her but it was probably at our North Carolina family reunion, eating chicken stew cooked in a large cast iron kettle over an open flame.  Surrounded by family I didn't know very well and in the mist of teenage angst I guess I didn't realize what an amazing person R. would grow to be.  Funnily too, we lived an hour away from each other at one point in college and never made the trip over the mountains to meet.    R. currently lives in NYC pursuing her passion, poetry.  She’s been through college, graduate school and now another masters degree for writing.  She's lived almost a whole life since we last talked and I guess, I have too.  We talked about NYC and my passion for that city and about poetry.  We have more in common than I can believe.  She is someone I wish had always been in my life and she was, I just didn't know it.  The cousin's wedding whom we were celebrating was brought about through similar circumstances.  A. and B. had gone to high school together, but didn't run in the same circles.  They both went on to college and jobs and lived in various other cities then met again a few years ago while both were back in their hometown.  Their friends say that A. and B. are perfect together, they compliment each other, and that they are deeply in love.    Why does it take years, sometimes lifetimes to realize that people who surround you are the ones that will compliment you in ways you can't even fathom?  It is as if we are not ready at times.  Friends, lovers, husbands, and wives may pass us along the street, but until we have fully grown into ourselves, it doesn't matter how often we meet.  When we are ready, hopefully they will be there.  It's as if we are all just ships passing in the night and I'm so thankful when somehow we meet again and our lives begin a new direction.         "

This morning i got in my truck placed the cd in the head unit and all the tracks were popping and hissing. Now here is the part that pissed me off all the mp3's I ripped sound great no popping or hissing. unless it's my burner I think the copy protection is a little backwards, I can rip files to my HD but I can't make a copy of the disc to preserve the life of the intellectual property I paid my hard earned money for.  The reason I think it is copy protection is I copied the new Fuel CD Natural Selection, and it sounds like the original.  Right now I am trying to copy the disc w/ xcdrost in Redhat 9.         "

3581210,male,InvestmentBanking,"             Sometimes this place really makes me think.  So many things are so different here (language, expressions, people, culture, shopping, driving habits) but, yet, some things are just like home.  Take my building, for instance, there are a few guards (we call them 아저씨, ajeosshi, or 'mister') in the lobby...well, they're no so much guards as they are greeters, like at Wal-Mart (neat article  urlLink here ).  After they figured I was not a visitor, but a long term resident of Seoul they started saluting me, waving and saying 'Morning'.  Huh, morning?  Ok, I guess they learned that greeting somewhere. Many Koreans in lower-level jobs know absolutely no English and what they may have learned these old timers probably had long forgotten, so I appreciated the effort.  Then I was inline skating (rollerblading to those of us who can pronounce it easily) one lovely 4AM and another 아저씨 said 'Morning!'.  Ok, that's two.  Interesting.  Then I got to thinking (well, it came to me while watching a Kia ad) that Morning is everywhere in Korea.  This morning (there I go again) I saw a give-away paper called 모닝 (Korean phonetic of morning) and then recalled the ad for  urlLink Kia's sub-compact car .  A simple search on Google Korea came up with more: an  urlLink online bookstore , an  urlLink online flowershop , a  urlLink golf site  and a  urlLink news organization .  Then there's  urlLink Good Morning Shinhan , one of the largest secutities dealers in Korea--with its flagship building in Yeouido, one of the largest in town and flaunting its name, albeit in Hanguel/Korean text, for all to see.  And, of course, this is the 'Land of the Morning Calm'. I could go on, but you get the point.  'Morning' is not without it's detractors, though.  About a year ago there was a major scam where a real estate developer conned million from many small investors.  One lady summed it up well saying, 'Now I know what it is like to go from a rich person to a begger in one day.' Definately not a good morning for her.  As an aside, apparently another Western idea is hamburgers, and in NORTH KOREA, no less.  (JoongAng Article  urlLink here .)  Here's your factoid for the day: although most words are pronounced and even used differently than the original, Korean has incorporated about 10,000 English words into its language; much like Tagalog/Filipino has a lot of Spanish and we Westerners are comfortable with Bon Appetit and Domo Arigato, Mr. Roboto.

But it's alright, it will be fun..fun..fun!! Finally, today's my first day off after working like crazy for the past two weeks. This morning I got a chance to have a cup of Starbucks' breakfast blend coffee with two slices of bread with chocolate sprinkles. Yumm!! And finally, I got a chance to go to sleep last night without having to set my alarm. I spent my morning by just sitting around in front of my computer, browsing, waiting for my bid at ebay to end, and chatting with  urlLink Mur  who's still having fun in Jakarta!! I 'envy' you!! I also talked to A-lie, one of my bestfriends since forever, on the phone today. It felt good to talk to her again. Actually, we laughed more than we talked!! I think the only people who can understand our jokes are us. We often lost touch, but we're still very good friends!! We talked about lots of things and came up with why people always ask sensitive questions to others such as virginity and sex. Those are like  'pertanyaan-pertanyaan yang kurang penting untuk dibahas ke orang lain.'  Those are like something that..I think we should just keep to ourselves. Like in Friendster for example, lots of those bulletin boards questions are about these subjects. And of course, no one will really be honest about their answers. It's just dumb!   Anyway, I'm thinking of moving to DC, which is where she lives right now, after I graduate, to apply for that broadcasting job that we're talking about. It sounds like a fun job, and it will be a great experience for me if I want to get a similar job back home. We'll see. I still have a year to go anyway.    My weekend? So far so good. Me and some friends went to see Spiderman 2  on Friday. It was good!! I like it better than the first one. Yesterday, I had to wake up early at 6 A.M. to work (yes..I work on weekends) and spent my afternoon with friends. We went to Whole Foods Market, a new organic store in town. It was really crowded inside the store and everything was so expensive!! After that, we had some Japanese food in downtown for dinner. As usual, me and Puma ended up at my place, watching the Food network channel. It was an okay night.  How's your weekend?            "

1708471,female,indUnk,"           “There’s the wind up, the pitch, and a swing and a miss.” As the announcers say, baseball may have its misses, but still has many hits at that too.   The time of year has come for baseball fanatics to show their spirit as the peak of the season starts. However, much is missed by those who just don’t appreciate the quality of professional baseball.   Those discriminate towards baseball first need to realize the cheapness of the sport. Most professional sports become very scaley in price, even for nose-bleed seats, such as Vikings tickets that cost _____. However, if you go on a Wednesday night to a Twins game, upper-level seats are only $3.00 for students and hot dogs are only a dollar. Even on a regular night to a Twins game, the cheapest tickets are only $5.00.   Baseball is also very fun, yet at the same time it is still a very relaxing sport. Opposed to basketball where you’re on your toes the whole time, watching the ball go back and forth, and football where you can just feel the ache and pain when someone gets hit, baseball allows you to just sit, watch and enjoy. Some of the only times fans get really excited in baseball is when the person next to them gets hit by a ball or some random fan goes streaking naked across the field.   However, if people see the relaxation aspect of baseball as boring, this could all be greatly fixed by the fans.   Some of the excitement of baseball is already created by the fans. There’s the wave, which is always fun to start, loud cheering and music, and the beach ball that always ends up in the outfield and taken away by security. Some fans, as we have seen, even progress to nudity. However, if this is not enough, it’s always fun to see people dressed in big, goofy costumes and pretend they are actually what they wear, such as Batman. Someday, this could be you.   Even if fans need to spice up the game a little bit, baseball is a great sport to watch, relax, and socialize all at the same time, at a very affordable price. The fact that baseball has been around forever, and continues as a traditional sport, not only shows that fans have had their eye on the ball, but on the game too.          "

Monday and Tuesday it was covered in the first half hour of the Today show (my only brush with network news anymore).  This morning it was not even mentioned.  Another similarity is in one of O'Neill's claims of the President being disengaged during Cabinet meetings.

589736,male,Technology,"            concerning HVTs, or 'high value targets' such as Osama Bin Laden and other Al Qaeda operatives:   ...Pakistani security officials have been told they must produce HVTs (high-value targets) by the election. According to one source in Pakistan's powerful Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI),  'The Pakistani government is really desperate and wants to flush out bin Laden and his associates after the latest pressures from the U.S. administration to deliver before the [upcoming] U.S. elections.'  Introducing target dates for Al Qaeda captures is a new twist in U.S.-Pakistani counterterrorism relations - according to a recently departed intelligence official, 'no timetable[s]' were discussed in 2002 or 2003 - but the November election is apparently bringing a new deadline pressure to the hunt.   Another official, this one from the Pakistani Interior Ministry, which is responsible for internal security, explains,  'The Musharraf government has a history of rescuing the Bush administration. They now want Musharraf to bail them out when they are facing hard times in the coming elections.'  (These sources insisted on remaining anonymous. Under Pakistan's Official Secrets Act, an official leaking information to the press can be imprisoned for up to ten years.)   A third source, an official who works under ISI's director, Lieutenant General Ehsan ul-Haq, informed tnr that the Pakistanis  'have been told at every level that apprehension or killing of HVTs before [the] election is [an] absolute must.'  What's more, this source claims that Bush administration officials have told their Pakistani counterparts they have a date in mind for announcing this achievement:  'The last ten days of July deadline has been given repeatedly by visitors to Islamabad and during [ul-Haq's] meetings in Washington.'  Says McCormack: 'I'm aware of no such comment.' But according to this ISI official, a White House aide told ul-Haq last spring that  'it would be best if the arrest or killing of [any] HVT were announced on twenty-six, twenty-seven, or twenty-eight July' - the first three days of the Democratic National Convention in Boston.    read the rest of the article  urlLink here .    concerning reports of Iraqi children being held in U.S. detention centers:   'According to information from the International Red Cross,  more than a 100 children are imprisoned in Iraq, including in the infamous prison Abu Ghraib.

1240631,male,Communications-Media,"       I finally read the  urlLink Da Vinci Code . It was a fun fast paced read. It was much better than  Digital Fortress .   In the Da Vinci Code, Dan Brown put together a nice coherent plot, likeable characters and enough controversy to get people talking. Apparently, people are eating the book up. It has been in print for over a year and there is still a waiting list at the library and used copies of the book have not dropped to the dollar level which generally happens as a best sellers move into the yesterday news category.  Overall, I found the book a fun work of fiction that provided some interesting insights into my favorite characters of history.  I do have to admit. In many ways, I am turned off by the message from many pop books and movies that paganism is somehow a superior (more rational and or more balanced) form of spirituality than christianity.   Yet, overall, I think the primary message of the book was on target. The book gives a strong reminder that the victors tend to rewrite history. Trying to actually base our life on any form of ancient writing is rather foolish as ancient writings have been seriously manipulated throughout the years.  The political forces of the dark ages led to a systematic destruction of the science and culture of the ancient Greeks. The destruction was similar to what we saw the Taliban doing in Afghanistan and we see the Islamic clerics doing in Iran. In order to add more legitimacy to one set of books and icons, there is a concerted effort to destroy other competing systems of thought.  As for people destroying history for religious reasons, here in Utah we actually have an extremely large and powerful University that actively works to falsely interpret the history of the Maya, Aztecs and other native Americans to fit what is, most likely, a fictional account of the Americas.  To add an element of conflict to the Da Vinci Code, Dan Brown gives the reader the grand daddy of all conflicts...the conflict between man and women. The primary premise of the book is that the Vatican has conspired to destroy the sacred female. The priory of sion is actively engaged in trying to preserve the ancient religious texts that hold a different role for women.  The idea of a central conflict ruling the entire history of mankind is extremely compelling. This is much like what Hegel was doing with his Philosophy of History. He had the world moving through these thesis/antithesis conflicts. Claiming to be a scientist, and claiming his conflicts were scientific, Hegel gave the world a very compelling history.  Having fictional scholars speak authoratively on a controversial subject is a strong literary device. I can see why the book shelves are now full of refutations of the Da Vinci Code as the different fictional accounts of history battle eachother for supremacy.   As for real history. A few days ago I saw the tale end of an interview by Richard Rubenstein for a work called  Aristotle's Children . I placed an order for the book, and am looking forward to its arrival on my doorstep.  If we really want to look at fundamental conflicts at the foundation of society, I think that looking at the ebb and flow of interest in logic is far more telling indicator of the progress of civilization that the conflicts of religion. It seems to me that when there is a due appreciation of logic, the society rises. When the society is dominated by revelation and mumbo jumbo...it declines.         "

883178,male,Fashion,"            You'd think I'd have an inferiority complex...    1. What vehicle do you drive?   I don't.  I don't have a car.  How do I get around?  Bus, subway, cab, train, and airplane.  Don't hate.   2. How long have you had it?   I  haven't  had a car for almost 3 years.  Some of the best years of my life.  No worries, no payments, and I never have to be the designated driver.   3. What is the coolest feature on your vehicle?   What's cool about the bus - sometimes you get crazy drivers who won't let  anyone  get in their way.  Near-death experiences are a great way to start the day.   I like cabs because cabbies always have NPR on, they know the quickest ways around the city and to the airport, and they tell you interesting stories about why they came to America.  Trains are great - esp the Amtrak to Milwaukee.  Everytime I go to M-city I see the same guy who hands out snacks and tells us when we've crossed over into 'America's Dairyland.' He sometimes gives me a free Heineken.  I hate planes.  Nothing cool about them at all.   4. What is the most annoying thing about your vehicle?   You get the crazies on the bus.  Once I saw a homeless lady throw-down on a business man because he tried to sit next to her.  Funniest shit ever.  (He wasn't hurt, the cops came on and threw her off.)  Sometimes cabs can really reek.  Bad.  Either with BO or about 10 of those hanging vanilla tree things.  I don't know who told these guys quantity was better than quality.     5. If money were no object, what vehicle would you be driving right now?   One of the biggest things I'm looking forward to when I move to the Twin Cities is owning a car again.  One of the biggest things I'm  not  looking forward to when I move to the Twin Cities is owning a car again.  But I know I'll have to get one.  It's a car town.

3359005,male,Student,"             Here is my supposed-to-be-unopiniated summary of the 4th leg of the race. I want to start off on a particular note, the note that basically says that Colin is a dirty, lowdown, son of a bitch. There, the start to my opinionless summary.  Ok so the teams got the clue at the pit stop, telling them to take a 20-hour bus ride to Buenos Aires, where they'll get their flights to Russia. Woohoo! New destination! Anyway, the teams arrived at the bus station one by one, and everything was closed. They agreed that they would get their tickets in the order to arrive, but when Colin & Christie talked to a ver sad man, they found here was a bus that left 3 hours later but still arrived at the same time. The queue rearranged, because of that scum of the earth. Mirna pissed off a few people, and drew an absolutely ucalled for 'Don't talk to me' when she tried to ask Lance what was happening. The piece of shit went and bought tickets for 4 other teams, because 'that's the order in which they were there.' Hello colin... I didn't see any queue!??!         The four behind teams rushed to the airport, where Charla & Mirna standbyed on a Swiss Air flight. I really don't know if they knew about the flight to Germany at this point, cause they were playing push barbie around the airport and not bothering to find another flight. The twins & Bowling moms worked together while Bob & Joyce had no time to look. And everyone left... Oooh! Look who's the business loser this time. Bob & Joyce got business class seats! Haven't they learnt from 4 previous seasons? Anyway, everyone leaves and Charla & Mirna are left behind. They unexpectedly catch the Marshall & Lance flight. Like I said, I don't know if they knew already that there was this flight, but if they did, they're the airline experts for this season.  So, everyone arrives in Russia, and they find the stupid battleship. Fro the first time since the first leg, we see the Yield! The Detour: Block 5 shots, in which the teams travel to a nearby skating ring and have to block 5 ice hockey slap shots. And Drink 1 shot, in which the teams had to travel further away to do this traditional drinking thing. It's obvious to me that the drinking was much easier, and unfair also cause Charla's arms length would be too short. For some reason, there's no pictures with Charla looking absolutely hilarious in the ice skating outfit.         They had to find a bronze horseman in the middle of St. Petersburg, which is a waste of time route marker cause they didn't do anything there. They were then told that they had to go the the Old Tower for the most exciting Roadblock ever. Caviar, the most expensive salt there is on the market. The favourite topping for the high society table was wasted on one of the best thought Roadblocks I've ever seen. 1 friggin kilogram per person, which makes a total of 8 kilos. Now if 100 grams cost about 50 bucks, 1kg wouls cost 500, and 8 would cost the producers a whopping S$4000!         Anyway, the sodium chloride imbalance in most of the eaters mentally balanced Chip, who finished it in monster speed. The only other guy who ate, Marshall, could not match up, but was still miserably fast. Brandon and Colin are IDIOTS! The best eater was Charla, followed by Joyce. Nicole fell terribly sick, which shows she already has a little imbalance on the caviar side. Christie did not fall as sick, which means she's perfectly normal. Oh what a chemically incorrect task, but who cares anyway?  The teams all made thier way to Catherine's Palace, their pit stop. Yadda and Bob & Joyce were eliminated! Now, the producers are going to have to pay for the huge water bills that the caviar eaters were going to drink.                 "

2821801,female,indUnk,"           With all the flap going on about WMD in Iraq, I think this article found on  urlLink Slashdot  is worth mentioning.  It has to do with the CIA secretly sabotaging software the Russians  bought  (UPDATE: 'stole') to run their pipelines.  Opposition to this Administrations handling of the situation in Iraq is founded on the premise that we have not yet found WMD's - fair enough, as far as Joe Average/non-CIA knows.  What today's 'anti-Bush' crowd don't seem to understand is there were many many many reasons to depose of Saddam (womens rights, mass torture/murder, environmental issues to name a few) - however, b/c of the extreme ignorance of the American populous (admit it folks), the administration calculated it would pursue the avenue that would strike the *most* fear in your average American, hence our rationale became 'WMD proliferation'.  Does that mean they 'sexed up the dossier' as has been purported, or that 'Bush lied' - IMO, no, it simply means the President carefully selected his argument.  He consequently won 'the debate' too.  Hindsight being 20/20 doesn't mean shit - I think we can all  agree that with Saddam being gone, the world is a better place.  How all this ties into the slashdot article, is that people who do their homework also knew there were many more reasons to 'invade' Iraq.  In this instance (slashdot article) - we are only NOW (12 years later) finding out about  one  of the tactics our Government (under Reagan) used to cripple the Soviet Union.  According to 'today's' anti-Bush crowd argument, the government should have fully disclosed to  ALL  American Citizens what it intended to do to Russia, have Congress approve it, then have the UN ratify the action.  Honestly folks, how effective would that have been?  Same difference in going to the UN to actually enforce something pertaining to Iraq - I mean, we've already shown the extent of corruption within the UN, and how that pork-barrell bullshit flowed through to Hussein as well.  Intentions were compromised at our (as a Nation) expense.  Ridiculous, effing ridiculous.         "

4013263,female,Automotive,"                 I met Brian in January 2003. We started dating February 4, 2003.&nbsp; He is the longest boyfriend I have had that was not over a distance for some time. We started living together in October 2003.&nbsp; I love him very much. He is my friend, lover, and future husband (Hopefully).&nbsp; I do not want to have children and he does not pressure me to have them.&nbsp; We have our disagreements about something, but they have always seemed to work out. The only thing that hinders our relationship is the fact his parents hate me from the get go. They hate everyone. Brian is really hard up for their approval (which he will never get from anything he does) from them. We fight about his parents more than anything. He still has not told them we live together. He has not spoken to them in almost 7 months.&nbsp; It is a really long time not to speak to your family.&nbsp; I talk to my family about once a week.&nbsp; I think the fact that I wrote them a letter telling his parents how I feel and what they are doing really made Brian mad. Brian cannot stand up for himself&nbsp; or anyone to them. So I stood up for myself. I don't think I did anything wrong except putting things in writing instead of only calling them. Spoken words fade away.&nbsp; Written words people can dwell on their misery. I spoke the truth from my viewpoint.&nbsp; I tried straightening up what they thought about me, but they only made me cry and pushed me away. They are the most miserable people I have ever met in my entire life.&nbsp; Brian tends to get sucked into their misery and believes sometimes it is his fault.  Brian has a hard time with people.&nbsp; He always wants other people's approval for everything.&nbsp; He struggles with this on a daily basis. He suffocates what he really thinks so people will like him.&nbsp; There is a line you draw when it comes to people's approval.&nbsp; I think Brian is willing to cross the line sometimes.&nbsp; He becomes so concerned about what people think of me, that it is irritating. I don't care too much what people think. I have good and bad days and if someone catches me on a bad day, or if I do not like them, I do not hide my feelings.&nbsp; Brian has a hard time with this. He would rather me suck them all in and squash them as he does with his.&nbsp; I think Brian has a lot of growing up to do and a lot of hardening up as well. Brian has never had a job where his life depended on the money. He always had something to prevent that situation. He doesn't understand when I am tired because he can sleep however much he needs. He cannot understand me wanting to sit around because I am never home. He is always at home. He cannot understand that I am around people all the time and need my space. I think all this will change once he finally is completely on his own and working full time to pay off his debts from being in school.  Don't get me wrong, Brian is a wonderful person, but every wonderful person has their flaws.       "

Because somehow I think people want to read about the things I buy, people that piss me off, and movies that I hate/love.  Uh...people do want to hear that stuff, right?  Right?  Actually, my previous blog Soft Drink needed to be shut down because it caused a couple sets of moist eyes.  I miss my old blog, but love my guest-starring role here on Pandyland.  Yo, word is bond.    2. Do people you interact with day to day or family members know about your journal/blog? Why or why not?  A couple of 'em, I guess.

What direction would you like to have your journal/blog go in over the next year??    I'm actually adapting all of our entries into a screenplay.  I'm going to pitch it in Tinseltown later this year.  The hardest part was trying to keep all of Panda's exploits down to a PG-13 rating.  Not an easy job, yo.  And I'm really trying to make HAL's character a bit more punchy.  Duf's motivation is somewhat questionable, too.  I've had early script-reviewers tell me he doesn't make a convincing protagonist.  I think the lovey-dovey feeling that Stoner's smitten character-in-love provides acts as a great balance to Panda's crazy Chicago-night escapades.  I'm not sure where I fit into all of this, but I'm hoping to write a car chase in for myself.  Hopefully I'll be able to have my character fire an Uzi out the window.  I've always wanted to do that.    5. Pimp five of your favorite journals/blogs.     I don't really have any favorites.

Cecilia, you're breaking my heart You're shaking my confidence daily Oh Cecilia, I'm down on my knees I'm begging you please to come home Come on home Making love in the afternoon with Cecilia Up in my bedroom (makin' love) I got up to wash my face, When I come back to bed Someone's taken my place Cecilia, you're breaking my heart You're shaking my confidence daily Oh Cecilia, I'm down on my knees I'm begging you please to come home Come on home Jubilation She loves me again I fall on the floor and I'm laughing Jubilation She loves me again I fall on the floor and I'm laughing wo-oh-ooooh-oh, wo-oh-oh-oh-oh wo-oh-oh-oh-oh,oh-oh-oh-oh-oh...     Bookends by Simon And Garfunkel  Time it was and what a time it was it was A time of innocence a time of confidences. Long ago it must be I have a photograph preserve your memories they're all that's left you.     El Condor Pasa by Simon And Garfunkel  I’d rather be a sparrow than a snail Yes, I would If I could I surely would I’d rather be a hammer than a nail Yes, I would If i only could I surely would Away, I’d rather sail away Like a swan that’s here and gone A man gets tied up to the ground He gives the world Its saddest sound Its saddest sound I’d rather be a forest than a street Yes, I would If I could I surely would I’d rather feel the earth beneath my feet Yes, I would If I only could I surely would     For Emily,Whenever I May Find Her by Simon And Garfunkel  What a dream I had Dressed in Organdy Clothed in crinoline Of smoky burgundy Softer than the rain I wandered empty streets down Past the shop displays I heard cathedral bells Tripping down the alleyways As I walked on And when you ran to me Your cheeks flushed with the night We walked on frosted fields Of juniper and lamplight I held your hand And when I awoke And felt you warm and near I kissed your honey hair With my grateful tears Oh, I love you girl Oh, I love you     Homeward Bound by Simon And Garfunkel  I'm sitting in the railway station. Got a ticket for my destination. On a tour of one-night stands my suitcase and guitar in hand. And ev'ry stop is neatly planned for a poet and one-man band. Homeward bound, I wish I was, Homeward bound, Home where my thought's escaping Home where my music's playing, Home where my love lies waiting Silently for me. Ev'ry day's an endless stream Of cigarettes and magazines. And each town looks the same to me, the movies and the factories And ev'ry stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be, Homeward bound, I wish I was, Homeward bound, Home where my thought's escaping, Home where my music's playing, Home where my love lies waiting Silently for me. Tonight I'll sing my songs again, I'll play the game and pretend. But all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity Like emptiness in harmony I need someone to comfort me. Homeward bound, I wish I was, Homeward bound, Home where my thought's escaping, Home where my music's playing, Home where my love lies waiting Silently for me. Silently for me.    I Am A Rock by Simon And Garfunkel  A winter's day In a deep and dark December; I am alone, Gazing from my window to the streets below On (a) freshly fallen silent shroud of snow. I am a rock, I am an island. I've built walls, A fortress deep and mighty, That none may penetrate. I have no need of friendship; friendship causes pain. It's laughter and it's loving I disdain. I am a rock, I am an island. Don't talk of love, But I've heard the words before; It's sleeping in my memory. I won't disturb the slumber of feelings that have died. If I never loved I never would have cried. I am a rock, I am an island. I have my books And my poetry to protect me; I am shielded in my armor, Hiding in my room, safe within my womb. I touch no one and no one touches me. I am a rock, I am an island. And a rock feels no pain; And an island never cries.     Mrs Robinson by Simon And Garfunkel  And here's to you, Mrs. Robinson, Jesus loves you more than you will know. (Wo wo wo). God bless you please, Mrs. Robinson, Heaven holds a place for those who pray (Hey hey hey, hey hey hey). We'd like to know A little bit about you For our files. We'd like to help you learn To help yourself. Look around you. All you see Are sympathetic eyes. Stroll around the grounds Until you feel at home. And here's to you, Mrs. Robinson, Jesus loves you more than you will know. Wo wo wo. God bless you please, Mrs. Robinson, Heaven holds a place for those who pray Hey hey hey, hey hey hey. Hide it in a hiding place Where no one ever goes. Put it in your pantry with your cupcakes. It's a little secret, Just the Robinsons' affair. Most of all, you've got to hide it from the kids. Coo coo ca-choo, Mrs. Robinson, Jesus loves you more than you will know Wo wo wo. God bless you, please, Mrs. Robinson, Heaven holds a place for those who pray Hey hey hey, hey hey hey. Sitting on a sofa On a Sunday afternoon, Going to the candidates' debate, Laugh about it, Shout about it, When you've got to choose, Every way you look at it you lose. Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio? A nation turns its lonely eyes to you Woo woo woo. What's that you say, Mrs. Robinson? 'Joltin' Joe has left and gone away' Hey hey hey, hey hey hey.     The Boxer by Simon And Garfunkel  I am just a poor boy. Though my story's seldom told, I have squandered my resistance For a pocket full of mumbles, Such are promises All lies and jest Still, a man hears what he wants to hear And disregards the rest When I left my home And my family, I was no more than a boy In the company of strangers In the quiet of the railway station, Running scared, Laying low, Seeking out the poorer quarters Where the ragged people go, Looking for the places Only they would know Lie-la-lie... Asking only workman's wages I come looking for a job, But I get no offers. Just a come-on from the war zone On Seventh Avenue I do declare, There were times when I was so lonesome I took some comfort there. Lie-la-lie... Then I'm laying out my winter clothes And wishing I was gone, Going home Where the New York City winters Aren't bleeding me, Leading me, Going home In the clearing stands a boxer, And a fighter by his trade And he carries the reminders Of ev'ry glove that laid him down Or cut him till he cried out In his anger and shame, 'I am leaving, I am leaving.' But the fighter still remains Lie-la-lie...       Scarborough Fair-Canticle by Simon And Garfunkel  Are you going to Scarborough Fair... Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme Remember me to one who lives there; She once was a true love of mine. Tell her to make me a cambric shirt (On the side of a hill in the deep forest green) Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme (Tracing a sparrow on snow-crested ground) Without no seams nor needlework (Blankets and bedclothes the child of the mountain) Then she'll be a true love of mine (Sleeps unaware of the clarion call) Tell her to find me an acre of land (On the side of a hill, a sprinkling of leaves) Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme (Washes the ground with silvery tears) Between the salt water and the sea strand (A soldier cleans and polishes a gun) Then she'll be a true love of mine Tell her to reap it in a sickle of leather (War bellows, blazing in scarlet battalions) Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme (Generals order their soldiers to kill) And to gather it all in a bunch of heather (And to fight for a cause they've long ago forgotten) Then she'll be a true love of mine Are you going to Scarborough Fair? Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme Remember me to one who lives there; She once was a true love of mine.     omg soo many more GREAT songs im just tired.....ill write more later...if i wanna talk about my feelings or w/e           "

There we were, me and Debbie in the crowd up front as Charles, Jas and Kelly watched from an elevated step. Half the crowd in front of us were jumping up and down, the other half bopping, and the rest behind us watching with cool aloofness, while amidst all this stood two Asian girls head-banging their brains out, arms flailing about, looking like a cross between scarecrows on acid and chickens coming in for a landing. It was WILD. And it was Awesome. And it was pretty short - only about 1 hr long. We wanted MORE!!!  The gig left us on a natural high - Debbs wound the car window down and screamed into the night breeze, scaring the woman in the car next to us at the traffic light, while I just kept smiling and going 'Wooohooo!!'. A bunch of kookies we were. But we had SO much fun, and I haven't done this in a really long time, a couple of years in fact! So it was great to just let go at the gig, especially since we were anonymous beings in a sea of unknown faces. I'm sooooo glad I went, and sooooo glad that Debbie went too, to be my rockin' partner. 'Coz it's not really something you can do alone you know? You need a friend next to you, doing the same wild things, so you won't feel too insecure, even if there is a crowd of people around you.

3711014,male,BusinessServices,"           A lot of people believe that an employer’s decision on  hiring a candidate depends on just skills and experience.  Well they couldn’t be farther from the truth because that is  false.    Here is the truth…      Skills and experience within your profession aren’t what  gets candidates the job. The truth is that there are too  many candidates with the proper skills and experience to get  the job, and ONLY one usually gets the job.       Companies are looking for more than skills and  experience these days. So it’s extremely important that you  all your individual characteristics mirror your passion.    So what are the other factors that are usually invisible to  candidates?   **Self-Awareness** – who are you and where are you going?  What are your plans for the present and the future? How do  you know what you want? How do you know that you’re right  for this job? Employers want to make sure that you’re not  lost.   **Learning Skills** – Are you willing to learn? Are you  current on trends and technology? Are you a person who loves  to “grow” within their profession? You want to show an  employer that you’re a candidate that learns in order to  progress your career.    **Adaptability** - With everything changing so rapidly  today, it’s possible that tomorrow your skills may no longer  be relevant. Are you a person who adapts well to change?   **Character** - Do you show passion in your industry,  because when you do, it projects through your résumé, cover  letter, and especially during the interview. An employer  wants a dependable trustworthy employee. The more you  project your positive character, the better!        You can have a huge advantage over your competition by  going one step. Create a career portfolio and within it make  sure that you showcase all the categories above in the  proper manner. I guarantee that this will give you a major  edge over your competition.        So you see that it’s not all about skills and  experience. It’s really important that you consider the  factors above, because them alone can get you the job.     =========================================================== David Green is an author and hiring manager of Distinguish  Marketing, LLC.

4192173,male,Technology,"             I'm leaving shortly to go to the studio to work with B and our special guest Leo V23, who is in town for a spell and has been roped into to add even more to this album (hopefully in the form of some sharp backing vocals). I'm psyched to have Leo on our turf for a change and I expect a productive day (once we stop talking about the genius of Cerati). Stay tuned.  In the meantime, last night, Irene and I checked out RUNNING ON KARMA starring my man Andy Lau and the beautiful Cecilla Cheung, at the 2004 New York Asian Film Festival. I might have discussed this film when I saw it some months ago (I'm a big fan), so the chance to see it on 35mm in a screening room was a must do for me. Irene had heard about it and had wanted to see it as well, so that got us to the theatre on time. Seeing a HK film on a movie screen in a movie theatre brought me back to my youth when I would sneak down to the Bowery (aged 10) to see whatever new movies were coming out of HK. Sadly there are no more Chinatown movie houses, so one must recapture their youth at these new kind of events. But the feeling was great. Go to the festival before this week is out. Some awesome movies are playing (like HERO and INFERNAL AFFAIRS). You can learn about at the Festival at http://www.subwaycinema.com/frames/nyaff04home.htm  Meanwhile, and I'm not sure why she bought this, while we were wandering about the upper west side the other night (don't tell anyone we were up there), Irene picked up the Ryan Adams CD LOVE IS HELL. Now, honestly, the guy seems to be a douche. When I first saw him, he was a douche singing in front of the Twin Towers and happened to grab some press because he filmed it before the Tradge (as it's called here). He's always in NME being, well a douche and because he lives nearby here, until recently I would see him quite a bit, quite often at the Gramercy, looking like, well, a douche, and usually with extremely funny but insane movie star girlfriend (who I hope is not a douche). He was recently photographed at my least favourite bar ever Black and White, which confirmed his huge douchedom. Also the cover of this album has two photos of himself, which makes it twice the necessary daily dose of doucheness.  I'm under the impression Irene bought this for Adams' cover of Mr. Gallagher's WONDERWALL, which is quite legendary if you read NME enough like I do. I'm told this CD is two EP's combined into one CD because his label, obviously douches, felt the material was 'too dark' to release as a full length. Well thats kinda wack because this CD is REALLY awesome. And the Oasis cover does live up to the NME hype. Yes it's dark, but his lyrics are solid and his melodies are sweet and I keep going back to the CD, no matter how many times I have the urge to listen to Ministry ;-)  Well, thumbs up for that douche at the Gramercy. The fucker can write some tunes. Lesson learned: look beyond on the douche and listen to the tunes. You'll be shocked what you hear.   Do that with Ass Cobra as well.  F          "

1708471,female,indUnk,"           Oh man this is why bio is so fun! Ok well at least this is why this chapter is so fun! Warning this is kind of graphic, but then again it is coming straight from my bio book:   Humans and several other primates are unusual in having no distinct mating periods; females are potentially receptive to males throughout the year. In humans, the sexual behavior called 'making love' may have evolved as a way to strengthen the bond between mates, as well as to promote the union of egg and sperm. Our sexuality is emotional as well as physical, and we have highly varied sexual expression.  The physical events of the human sexual respone occue in a sequence of four phases. During the excitement phase, sexual passion builds, the penis and clitoris became erect, and the testes, labia, and nipples may swell.  The vagina secretes lubricating fluid, and muscles tighten in the arms and legs. These responses continue during the plateau phase, which is marked by increases in breathing and heart rates. Orgasm follows, characterized by rhythmic contractions of the reporductive structures, extreme pleasure for both partners, and ejaculation by the male. The resolution phase reverses the previous responses; the structrues return to normal size, muscles relax, and passion subsides.  Hahaha, I love it, I really do. It's funny because I bet so many people have gone out and had sex after reading that, haha school makes sex sound exciting and 'enjoyable.' Haha, not too often school makes you horny, lol. Ok me done.          "

God I loved it while I had it, but it's time to&nbsp;get up&nbsp;and get some cash in the dwindlin bank account. and I'll also be getting some fitness work for the 'ol resume.    2.  I went out for my first night on the town with  friends  last night. That's right, I said friends. we did some boozing in the Virginia Highlands part of town&nbsp;and had some good times. Although I am generally not a 'go out all the time' kind of gal, I miss being able to call up people to hang out for some drinks, music and conversation. So it felt pretty nice to enjoy the evening. And the Atlanta men were quite the sight for sore eyes...which leads me to #3...    3.  I'm done with stupid internet dating. I signed up to meet people when I moved here and if I hadn't met Isaac (drinking and band buddy) it would have been a total bust. Jebus. I suppose my rules of not dating Confederate-flag-totin, ZZ Top-beard-wearin, guys-who-can't-form-a-coherent-sentence really limited me. I'm an independent babe and if I think someone is attractive, I have no problem initiating the conversation (this is over email, for crissakes) but so far NOTHING.&nbsp;Are the girl/guy roles are different in the South??   Anyways, things are going real well here. I miss the 'landahz very, very much and look forward to a jamboree soon (pending airline prices!) take care y'all.  -BB            "

Sometimes, though, one needs to check the veracity of the figures put in the papers...especially the local ones.  Here are two examples of how the English version of the Korea Times and that of the JoongAng Ilbo (Daily).  The first is pretty straightforward.   urlLink Korea Times  said that 249 people were arrested for forging Korean passports, but  urlLink JoongAng Ilbo  says just 114 were accused.  Huh?  Another one:  urlLink JoongAng Ilbo  said that S&P is positive on Korean banks (a good thing), while the  urlLink Korea Times  said that S&P was a tad worried about the bad loans that banks extended to small and medium-sized firms.

Well, in order to thwart the impending quarter life crisis that I and most of my friends could embark on in the next months or years- I am starting this blog to make fun of my future activities.  As of now, I am looking for a new job and a new man- the latter activity alone could provide hilarity!!!!  Success of either could help with the mountain of college and grad school debt that is hovering over me like a mosquito in an Atlantan summer.  SO- the misadventures begin!  If you can help out with any of my activities- let me know, save me from the embarrassment of it all!!!   To get things going, my all knowing mother decided that she would make some demands of me today that involve my goals (paying debt, finding man, finding job!).  The demand: Join the Alumnae Associations of your schools.  Not a bad idea I thought- I paid lots of money and studied sort of hard for these diplomas and now I must bleed the alumnae associations for all they are worth.  So, as of tonight, I have sent out multiple emails to Wellesley and LSE and I have even joined the Ivy/Seven Sisters Singles group.  Yeah, fun with Ivy leaguers...let the games begin...

3705830,male,Non-Profit,"       a slow day; getting things done like cutting your toenails tend not to count as truly productive, they are to the working day as shampoo is to the shopping list: something that occasionally has to be done, but more of an imposition than anything else.  thesis word count: 650  like i say, a slow day. but, i have been having some fairly interesting thinks. i mean thoughts.  i) truth: if everything we know or learn is (necessarily) brought to us by our own perception, then it doesn't matter whether there is any absolute truth because we will never know it.  ii) labels: labels on relationships only serve to give rise to expectations of certain behaviour; expectations drawn from the media, demographic ensembles and hearsay that can never realistcally be matched by any random (that is to say non-specific) individual. this mis-matching of expectation with reality (regardless of how perfect the reality) leads to disappointment and eventually conflict. the need to categorise things is an outward desire, and serves no purpose to the individuals involved, who will tend to know what's going on. the driving force is to have a neat labelled pigeon-hole-type box for the relationship that others will understand with the minimum of explanation; but if every relationship (an analogue quantity if every there was one) is forced into one of any number of discrete boxes (digital classification) then the fit will never ne perfect (analogue-to-digitl conversion, and information is irrevocably lost). its just  laziness , that's all. pisses me off that people can break up over such an unnecessary thing.  iii) gravy boats and gravy trains. no gravy planes.  iv) language: when was the last time anyone described themselves to you as 'hot' or 'cold', instead of 'really hot' or 'really cold' (or the like)? language is something that people invented, and yet they don't use it properly? if words have definitions, and we can invent new words with appropriate definitions as needs be, then why isn't language sufficient to expess what we want to say? and if it  is  sufficient, then why don't we use it properly? this follows a conversation i had recently, which went roughly as follows:  ros: i guess that depends on what you mean by 'happy'. guil: the oxford english dictionary defines it as 'feeling or showing pleasure or contentment'. ros: yeah, well i wouldn't define it  that  way.  anyone else find that amusing/frustrating? mind you, to get technical, i guess it depends how you define 'definition'. or something.   enough thoughts! i should get out more.  v) i should get out more.   todays's list is of synonyms for 'list': bank careen heel incline lean slant slope tilt tip   n.

It was 'Romeo et Juliette', performed in French by the  urlLink Florida Grand Opera .    This was an early birthday present for her, as she turns 11 next month.  I was a little concerned that, being only 10, she may get a little bored.   After all, this is a long one, at 3 hours and 15 minutes - with 2 intermissions.  She donned a new outfit - black skirt, white blouse with sparkly brooch; she did up her hair, put on a little lip gloss and selected an evening bag.  Topped off with my black wrap, she looked as if she'd always gone to the Opera.  She sat perched on the edge of her seat for many scenes, my opera glasses at the end of nose, peering alternately at the stage and the English translations.  I was so proud of her, and so glad that I was able to expose her to something that I think is just wonderful.  She agreed with me; it is something wonderful and she said she really liked it.   She's already selected at least two operas from next season that she would like to see.  Ah, my little diva is growing up.  Diva out.           "
2844168,female,Marketing,"                 Well, SupaK and I made it home safely last night at 9 pm. What a whirlwind the last week was!! Let’s see if I can recap! I'll also try to post some pictures from the wedding later today.  Wednesday – SupaK headed up to Grand Rapids to spend the day with Dave the Fish and then they headed to Spilk’s bachelor party. Sounds like they all had a lot of fun! SupaK then spent the night at Spilk’s with all the other guys. While he was hanging out and having fun, Karon and I spent the day slaving over wedding cakes. I think I smelled and tasted cake and frosting the rest of the week! ALL day long we baked, frosted and decorated SEVEN wedding cakes for the big event on Saturday. I think I finished up around 1 am that night. But it felt good to get most of the cakes done (we just had 2 left to do). The in-law’s don’t have air conditioning and that oven just heated that house right up. Oh my word!! We were roasting by the time dinner came around. We stopped around 5 pm and Karon headed to the rodeo with one of the cousins. Mom and I decided to pick up Aunt Elaine and Johnny and get into some air conditioning for dinner. Before we left I took a shower, and a cold shower never felt sooo good! We had a blast at Applebee’s with Elaine and Johnny. He is 5 and absolutely hilarious! We went to Wal-Mart after dinner and when he discovered the toy section you would think he had never seen a toy store before. He stretched his arms as wide as he could and exclaimed, “Look at this! This is just for kids! This is sooo AWESOME!” We were just cracking up! My favorite was when he proclaimed, again with arms stretched wide, “This is the moment I’ve been waiting for!!”&nbsp; After we dropped them off at Grandma’s Mom and I headed back to the house and I finished up the last 2 cakes. I fell into bed exhausted, and I dreamt about frosting cakes!! AHHH!! I couldn’t even get away from it in my sleep!!  Thursday – I headed up to GR and met up with Heather and Holly for lunch. I chat with them online all the time, but it was so nice to connect in person. Heather brought little Arwen and she is such a sweetie! She just sat there and smiled the whole time. I’m so happy for them! After lunch I hooked up with the SupaK and we headed over to Grand Haven to try to catch the Falcon and family one last time, but we missed them. So we ended up taking a nice walk on the beach and out to the lighthouse. We had been apart for 2 ½ weeks and then ever since Ked had arrived we had been on the go constantly. It was nice to have an hour to hold hands and walk up and down the beach just catching up. Even though the beach was a little dirty and the water was disgustingly black (Ked kept thinking of all the sewage that ran into Lake Michigan this spring due to the flooding!) it was a refreshing time. After our little walk we headed back to GR to catch up with some friends. We had dinner with Chris and Becca and Brian and Julie. We all knew each other from Cornerstone and had a blast catching up. All four of them just got married this spring and we enjoyed looking at their wedding and honeymoon pictures. The time flew by much too quickly, as it always does. Before we knew it we were headed back to Nashville for the final few days of our trip. When we returned home, Aunt Sarah and Aunt Elaine were unloading Sarah’s car and giggling. We knew something was up! The aunts had arrived to save the day and decorate Mom & Dad’s enclosed porch for the dress rehearsal dinner the next evening. They called themselves the “Dollar Store Queens!” Mom, Karon, and I got a kick out of that because we ALL know that Mom and Karon are the dollar store queens by far. Sarah and Elaine haven’t ever drove to Georgia to go to a dollar store. (Ok technically Mom didn’t either, but she made Dad stop at one on their way down to Florida!) They did a fabulous job decorating and had a lot of fun while doing so!  Friday – The last two days of the trip were by far the busiest!!! Friday morning Karon and I got up and put the last 2 cakes in the oven. She and Mom then headed to Lansing to pick up the fresh flowers for the cake and also a few items for the dress rehearsal dinner that evening. While they were shopping I watched the cakes and corralled Ked into helping me with some cleaning. No one can clean a bathroom as well as he does! By the time Mom and Karon returned Ked had cleaned the bathroom and half the house and I had lunch ready, as well as one cake frosted and the other ready to go. It was definitely a teamwork day as we raced to get everything ready for that evening. After lunch Mom worked on finishing the house and Karon and I finished the last 2 cakes and desserts for the dinner, cleaned the kitchen, and vacuumed. Meanwhile, Ked and Dad mowed the lawn! By 5:00 we had the place spick and span and the cakes were all in the fridge ready for tomorrow. We all rushed through the shower and then headed to dress rehearsal at the church. Rehearsal went well and without a hitch. Nate did a good job of keeping things moving! Afterwards we all headed back to Mom & Dad’s for a great pizza dinner from an awesome local pizza shop. We all hung out for awhile and then it was back to work! Kurt printed up the programs for tomorrow while Karon and I folded them. Then we corralled Dad and Ked to help Karon and I while we folded up 200 cake boxes! We managed to get to bed about 1 a.m. for a short night’s sleep before another long day.  Saturday – Kurt & Michelle’s big day finally arrived!! Karon and Kurt worked all morning on the flowers for the cake. Aunt Sarah and Aunt Elaine came over again and I helped them with some flower arrangements for the front of the church. We packed everything up and headed to the reception hall to set up the cake. The big moment….tiering the cakes! We had been nervous about this all week long. Our big 16” cake that was on the bottom had some shifting issues when we iced it. We loaded the cake with wooden dowels and prayed it would hold!! We raced to set it up and I don’t know what we would have done without Sarah and Elaine’s help! When it was all said and done, the cake was absolutely beautiful!! Karon and I took a step back and admired our work and then snapped a million pictures to remember it by! We then rushed off to the church. We were supposed to be there at 1:30 but we didn’t make it until after 2. That gave us just enough time to touch up our makeup and get into our dresses for pictures at 3 p.m.&nbsp; We gathered in the room around Michelle and tried to keep her from crying and messing her makeup before heading down the aisle! She was resplendent and radiant in her dress. It was just a perfect, beautiful day. The sun was shining, the humidity was low, and a nice breeze kept the temperature just perfect. Nate did a fabulous job officiating the ceremony. I think it was the most meaningful little message I’ve ever heard at a wedding. He talked about the importance of making Christ the cornerstone of their marriage. He even brought a brick (Nate always with the object lessons!) to serve as a reminder and asked them to paint today’s date on the brick while on their honeymoon. The ceremony was about 25 minutes, packed full of meaning, and fun! We then raced through pictures and headed to the reception for yummy stuffed pork chops and LOTS of cake!!! Around 8 p.m. things started to wind down and we said our goodbyes prepared for the LONG drive home. We left Nashville about 9 p.m. and determined to drive as far as we could. We made it halfway through Kentucky and stopped at a rest stop to sleep (if you can call it that) from 3:30-7:30 a.m.  Sunday – Driving, driving, and driving some more!! That pretty much sums up Sunday! Ked started to get sleepy again around 9:30 a.m. when we hit the Tennessee border. I had been dozing off and on so I took over the wheel. I burned through all of Tennessee and made it through Atlanta. We hit a patch of pretty hard rain in Tennessee, but thankfully it didn’t last for very long. Ked took over again and drove the rest of the way. We hit the Florida border at 5:30 p.m. and walked in our door at 9 p.m. While it was nice to get away and visit everyone, we were both ready to be at home and sleep in our own bed!! We unpacked the essentials and then took what I call the “Sigh Shower.” After traveling for so long and being away from home, it feels so good to wash away the travel dirt and get ready to sleep in your own bed. I can’t help but stand in the shower and sigh because it feels so good to be home! Needless to say, Sadie has been very needy ever since we walked in the door. Bobbie did a good job taking care of her, but you can tell she definitely missed our company. For awhile I wondered if she was going to let us sleep last night. She wandered around the house with her pathetic “Meooooowwww, Meoooowww” for awhile. Finally she jumped into bed between the 2 of us and purred away. She refuses to leave my side today. Wherever I am she has to be right next to me.  So that’s the rest of our trip in a nutshell! Today Ked headed off to some flash training for work. I’m finishing unpacking and doing laundry. Ked left the place absolutely spotless, which was sooo nice to come home too! All I have to do now is the laundry and put it away! What a great guy.  Well, I guess it’s back to the routine for a little while! Come visit soon!                "

We're still gathering information, so take none of this as firm word, but what seems to have happened, happened quickly.  He woke up, got up out of bed...and went down.  The paramedics who showed up suggested it was either an aneurysm or a massive stroke.  His family members have been informed, and all of the the cast have, as far as we can determine, also been informed.    This is a terrible loss for all of us.  Richard was a consummate professional but more than that he was an honorable, stand-up guy.  If he gave you his word on something, you never had to wonder about it afterward.  He was always helpful and supportive of all the cast, even those who only came in for one episode, always with a ready smile and determined to do whatever it took to make the scene work.  He was, quite simply, a terrific guy, and everyone here is just devastated at the news.  More word as this develops.

1708471,female,indUnk,"           Being tierd really does make you dazed and confused and not really aware what's happening around you. When you're tierd the main thoughts that go through your head is: beeeed, pillows, tv, sitting, and so one. Basically, I don't have much control over my mind when I'm tierd, which is most of the time, so that is why I'm blaming being tierd on why I'm eating so much. Actually I really don't think I'm eating that much, I'm just eating a lot of junk food and because this is the longest period of time I haven't been in a sport or exercising for like 5 years it feels like I'm getting fatter, but technically I'm really not.  Dazed. I really did already kinda explain this, but ya I basically am not paying too much attention whats going on around me, and really I don't care too much. It's just that I don't wanna go deep into anything or do anything 'cause well starting tuesday I'll be doing a million things. I've just been really out of it.  Confused. Ok first of all, when aren't I confused? Seriously, I would like this to be anwsered! But ya I'm just confused as to what everyone is like thinking right, like everyone seems to be acting a little different and seems to be like questioning something all the time now, yet still they don't speak out their mind, it's like everyone is just sitting in their own little corner waiting for someone to come to them to ask hey what's going on up there? Maybe it's because schools starting on tues and we're all a little scared and anxious and we're all questioning everything that'll be affected by that.   Boring Summer Blues. Ya I've been quite bored this week, I've been staying in my pajamas till 5:00 (first off I don't wake until 12, but still). But ya I'm weird though 'cause I really could not be bored and be doing something during the day, but I've been weird and not really cared if I did anything, I mean I can just go and call someone and be like hey wanna do something? and I'd be doing something, but I haven't been calling anyone, I've been waiting till they called me. It' just that either way I don't care. This could be because I'm just getting bored of people and things in general, I'm not so much bored doing nothing, because well that's always fun, but I'm bored of seeing the same people every day and doing the same stuff with the same people. I'm bored of the site I have to wake up to every day and the same generalization I get from each days happenings. I'm bored of the same fights best friends tend to have, over stupid guys and being too selfish, I'm bored of guys and not having a fricken love life and failing when one could possibly happen. I mean don't get me wrong, I'm having fun and I had a fun summer even though it was mostly with the same people, but I'm bored of it all. I need change, I love change, I linger for change, but I haven't gotten it. It really could just come done to I'm bored of life..... or at least my life as it is. Maybe it would be different now if I was playing a sport, 'cause it gives me something to do and something for me to see every day. It also provides change 'cause it's not like you're having the same practice every day and same game every day. I really do wish I was playing soccer now.... but ya it was for the best. Being bored sure is fine, but being bored of certain aspects of life just sucks, I almost believe it'll make you boring in the long run, if I am becoming boring, please tell me. I'm actually probably boring you with all this boredom talk. All I'm saying is that I need a little more pizazz in my life right now 'cause I'm starting not to even care because I'm so bored.

4192173,male,Technology,"             For weeks, if not the entirety of the hypefactor sessions thus far, F.J. repeatedly insisted that he recorded a moody piano part for a song dubbed 'Exist,' one of four or so that are quite well-developed at this point. The issue came up every time we listened to monitor mixes in the studio, and F. never hesitated to make a snide comment about my having deleted this brilliant part from the song, thereby ruining the entire album.  And for as many weeks, I insisted this was a load of bollocks. 'Exist' emerged from a demo of a song I attempted with another band about seven years ago that I modified drastically in August 2000. I have a lot of pride invested in the track, and I knew there was no way I would have lost a part for this song were it as amazing as F.J. recalled.  Well, I was wrong. But only about 40 percent wrong.  While sorting through files on the computer before my trip to Chicago last week, I came across a Cubase file called 'Stay' that I thought was nothing more than a drum loop I programmed last summer. Again, I was only partially wrong. It was indeed a galloping drum loop I wrote the summer before, inspired by the vintage techno of the  urlLink NewOrder-Chemical Brothers collaboration  'Here To Stay.' But I had forgotten about the fact that, during our first or second session of the summer, F.J. and I slowed it down to about 90 b.p.m. He added bass... and piano.  Shit.  To say F.J. was pleased would be a slight understatement. He is right - the riff was pretty good, and we built on it last night by adding some synth parts and guitars. I was told that Pink Floyd was my inspiration, and we also worked out a chorus riff that hugged the minor key piano and bass parts nicely.  I know already that the track will be a struggle to complete. My natural instinct as a guitarist and producer is to take a  urlLink Phil Spector  'Wall Of Sound' approach to recording, and I will have to resist the impulse to layer guitar upon guitar and effect upon effect with this track.    I am sure that F.J. would rather he told this story first, but I beat him to the punch. But the way I see it, he has me to thank for the fact that we found the song in the first place. Of course, I am also the one who ' lost ' the track all those weeks ago. But normally he would have been up at 8 or 9 a.m. writing this. Too much ' urlLink Grand Theft Auto: Vice City ' the night before, perhaps?  Pick up the slack, F!          "

If it is impossible to imagine someone who might legitimately value a different thing than you, then most likely you perceive a universe of absolutes.

1415200,female,Student,"           Okay,  so I found the magical wonders of xanga, and I must say, they've won me over. But I know some of you kids out there read this thing, so for the hell of it, I'll update.  So Cups, this one's for you. I think I'll start by giving you the expo on wensday, since it was rad and I heart it.  We left the house at 3:30 and go there at almost exactly 5. It was down at Blossom which was really nice. Then I found out I couldn't of taken in my camera because they don't allow it. And because it was pouring we had to take raincoats. (Yeah, it stopped raining about 20 mins afer we got in.) Then we watched Auf Der Maur. The lead, Melissa is the ex-bassist for the Smashing Pumpkins. Who,  in her age still rocked like a mother. I couldn't believe how rad she was. She is now my vanilla!  Then we watched Thursday, who is amazing live. Didn't expect that great of a job by them at all. Plus it was the last day of the tour for them, and they we're filming a rock movie called 'God's Lot,' (btw, second stage was in a parking lot.) After that (when everyone else left for a while) I stopped by and talked to him, Geoff, (lead of Thursday) for a good half hour. He's such a sweetheart, it's great how he listened to me. I wish I had more people like that around me more often. Gave me some good words of wisdom. Then came Muse. Oh dear dear me. I was so bloddy excited for them to come out. Okay so the stage wasn't more than the width of a classroom. Maybe a tad bit more. And where I was standing I was right on the baracade, and I was in front of Matt. Who I could easily drool over, let alone sweaty and with a rad guitar.  So they played, Hysteria, New Born, Butterflies and Hurricanes, The Small Print and Stockholm Syndrome. I was a bit dissapointed because I didn't get to hear 'Plug in Baby,' so what I did, was I yelled it really loud, as they were still on stage, and then the group of about 10 forigners screamed out was sounded like, 'Ploog En Bah-bay' but it was just there accent. It was still great. So they stopped, looked at each other, and came back on, and played it. I was so happy. Oh yeah, after Stockholm Syndrome, and after the riff thing they played after,  Matt was on the ground right in front of me, so when he stood up he was like, 'hugs for everyone,' and so I gave him a big hug, and kissed him on the cheek! (you only live once right?) and then he looked down at me, and was like, 'alright then,' and gave me a kiss back! I thought I was going to die. but I didn't! Then we decided to catch The Cure, who by all means suck live. Its like all stoner/elevator music. Horrible. So we left after the first 2 or 3 songs. It was like, 10:30 by the time we got out, and we wanted dinner, so we went to Denny's where we ended up running into Melissa from Auf Der Maur, talked to her for like 10 mins. then ate, and came home. Sound great? Yes! It was!          "
766556,female,indUnk,"        This is an improvement?  I'm getting a new, updated computer today.  Which, of course, will take me some time to get familiar with.  Yeah, I know computers, and I love technology, but I'm working with Windows NT here.  Moving up to XP and all the idiosynchrasies that come with it.  Still, it will be faster than what I'm working on now.  As it is, I can send a document to the printer, go down two flights of stairs, put 2 quarters into the coke machine, coke drops, go back up two flights of stairs, sit at my desk, open the coke, and voila, my document begins to print.  I'm not kidding.  And they wonder why I don't get to a lot of things.  Of course, working on my blog has nothing to do with my uncompleted work load *wink*  But, the clincher is this... now that I'm getting the fabulous new toy with a larger monitor and black casing I'll be in another software training for 4 hours of every day from now till January 25th.  That gives me 4 hours to complete 8 hours of work each day on my fabulous new toy.  You just can't win around here.  Diva out.         "
2948997,female,Student,"        My mentor sent me an email...which I thought was worth sharing   There are so many things I wanted to say while reading your letter, that it actually got me out of bed again-  FIrst, Its critical that you remain open-minded, not let your prejudices cloud your viewpoint..especially since you have so little real exposure to other cultures in situ..  you make a number of comments very derogatory to western civilization (corrupted, fake, commercial) that reveals your distaste and bias against it...So, before I get too far into this, tell me if there is any evidence, any argument possible, that would dispel that belief (not that I particularly want to)- If not, then you are holding your views as a religious person, in which facts and rationality take a back seat to prior learning, indoctrination, and negative emotions.  (note, this comp does not have a 'return' key, so this will just sort of flow James Joyce style).   You speak of the corruption of other cultures...It is true that the west has influenced others, as they have us, however, the use of corrupted is emotive-there are extremely good arguments to be made, as a liberal, that these influences have been greatly for the better, but again, that would be judgemental.  You also think that western culture is shallow, fake, and commercial- in some ways, perhaps, but your own outlook is as western (far more so in many ways than mine) as is possible.  I seriously doubt that you consider yourself, your views, as shallow and silly.    As well, I doubt that the other individual people in the west think they have shallow, ridiculous views. (Keep in mind, a culture is made of the collective values of the individuals in it).  Regarding our influence on other cultures, you'll be happy to know that it is much less than it used to be, and growing weaker each year...At the turn of the last century, all of Africa, China, Japan, Indo-china, and India were totally western dominated- Japanese businessmen wore suits, the ruling class in CHina was all western-educated, the governments of Africa were puppet regimes.  Western countries directly controlled over 90% of the population of the planet...this during a time in which the west saw itself as a universal culture, assured of its superiority, and forcefully attempted to indocrinate western views (see 'The Rabbit-Proof Fence' for example).  Today, the west directly controls less than 20% of the world population, China, Africa, and the Muslim states are very much different cultures than the west, latin America is becoming increasingly indian-ized etc etc.  The west as a whole controls far less resources, money, natural products, military power, industry, technology than it once did, and the gap is shrinking.   In addition, you speak of the 'west' as if its a monolithic, unchanging entity.  In truth, the culture of the US is increasingly becoming seperate from that of Europe, and will continue to do so.  Population growth in the US is primarily due to Hispanic and Asian immigration, while that of Europe is due primarily to the influx of prior communist populations.  Asians and Hispanics tend to be social conservative, and in the case of Asians, economically conservative, while the polish, east germans, etc will tend to be economically (but not socially) liberal.  In addition, western culture today is far far different than it was 100 years ago.  At around 1900, the only county in which you could have found a fairly large group agreeing with modern western concepts was the US- which was, until the last 50 years, by far the most liberal country in the world.  THere is a fascinating book called 'The clash of cultures' which outlines 7 major civilizations currently extant (of course one can parse them any way one wishes, but there is good rationale for this choice).    I've experienced all of them first-hand, some of them for long periods of time, and have found things I liked and things I didnt like about each.  I was also struck, in my travels, at the incredible narrowness of views in most foreign countries...these places do not have the North American history of multiple peoples coming together, nor any tradition of personal opinion, individual rebellion, or the concept of self-esteem.   Though the US and Europe have exported many trappings of western society (McDonalds, hollywood) these in reality have very very little influence on the core culture...Cultural waters run extraordinarily deep, and this is true to an even greater extent in western culture.    Another thing I was struck by, is the incredibly poor way women are treated in almost every otehr culture...African, Latin American, Arabic, Japanese, Indian...Not only do these cultures not espouse gender equality, they actively and vigorously denounce it.  One of the first of my 'central tenets' that fell was the idea that everyone believed, way down deep, that all peopel should be equal.  In fact, cultures in which people believe in gender equality account for a small minority of people-THe majority of the world thinks women are demonstrably (and in many cases pre-ordained by God) inferior to men.  Another shock was the deep-seated hatred and loathing for homosexuality.  In the great majority of places, this action is punishable by death (Africa both north and sub-saharan, China, almost all Arab countries, Iran, most of SW Asia) or imprisonment (India, many south american countries).  Acceptance of this is present in perhaps 10% of the worlds population, all of them western.  Attitudes towards children were shocking to me in some places-Of interest, China and Japan share with the west a great love of kids, and avoid physical punishment, but in much of the arab, latin American, and African worlds, children are regularly beaten, often severely (this varies a great deal in Africa, less so in the Muslim world).  Attitudes towards wealth also were interesting- In China and the Eastern European areas, those with wealth were mistrusted and disliked- This attitude is present, but reduced.   In western cultures- BUt in Africa, Japan, India, and the Muslim world, wealty people are treated like walking Gods-Untouchable, and deserving of the position they hold.  In fact, the role of 'strong-man' is much more prevelant in other cultures than here, and people will put up with much more abuse from those stronger then they, because they feel it is the right of strong people to act this way.  One last thing-other cultures are not zoos, in which their precious little attitudes and habits should be preserved so we in the west can enjoy them- Cultures are rapidly evolving entities, constantly influenced by foreign forces and internal developments.  Western culture is fairly new, but in reality, all the cultures are...our roots go back to Rome (though Rome stole most its culture wholesale from Greece), the Hebrews, the Orthodox church, etc...  We are not really 'like' the Romans or Greeks, or even Imperial Europe, though they were our cultural 'parents'.  India is not like it was in 1800, but then again, in 1800 it was far different than it was in 1700.  For the last 50 years, India and Japan have been free to pursue their own evolution- they have accepted some of what the west offered, and rejected others.  Europe was heavily influenced by the Moors in Spain, from which many things were added to European culture, and others rejected.  To think that the west can willy-nilly go into a place and overturn its culture is to fall for the same sin you despise, that of believing that western culture is so much more powerful, more attractive, more universal than any other that mere exposure will kill the host.  Other cultures are as deeply held and strong as ours, and the people in them are not children to be spoon-fed new systems.  Take Japan- Would they have been better off if Com. Perry hadnt forced western trade on them? The great majority of Japanese would say no- they were feudal, extremely poor, and had no technology or medicine to speak of, not were they exposed to any other culture but their own.  To say we should have left them thus is to treat them as sub-human, too delicate to speak with or trade with as adults and peers.  Western culture has had a strong influence on the world, but it has hardly overturned other civilizations- And the influence it has had has been one of ideas, paradigms, not commercial interests nor shallowness...McDonalds is not going to make a Muslim turn to Christ, nor is Hollywood going to convince the Chinese that homosexuality is OK, but the idea, and demonstration, of personal freedom, of weak democratic governments, of the strength of science over superstition-these are the things that change cultures.

3694096,female,Museums-Libraries,"             Oh, a nickel for every time I heard that at 7 am.  Well, I guess I would have a nickel, but the moral of the story is, if on the first day you have your new phone and the number used to belong to a sanitation removal company, change it.  Don't think it will eventually go away.  Just change it.  June 1st my roommate and I had a new phone number/new apartment.  June 1st we started getting about 30 calls a day about picking up peoples trash.  The calls would start around 6:30 in the morning and last until at least 7 at night.  What I liked the best was when a woman called and asked for my father.  I said, uh, no, he wasn't there.  She laughs and said, Are you sure [little girl].  I told her that I was pretty sure he wasn't there, since he didn't live with me.  She only called back about five times to make sure.  Now, most of these calls it was fairly obvious they had the wrong number.   First scenario.   Me: Hello?   Them: Yeah, hi, you didn't come get my trash today.   Me: Sorry, you have the wrong number.   Them: What? Isn't this ....  Me: Yeah, but they don't have this number anymore.   Them: Do you know what their new number is?   Me: No.  Bye.  Second scenario. Me: Hello? Them: [something in a language I don't speak] Me: Sorry, you have the wrong number. Them: [more of the language I don't speak or understand] Me: YOU HAVE THE WRONG NUMBER.  THEY DON'T HAVE THIS NUMBER ANYMORE. Them: Hang up and call again. Four or five times.  The final straw for us came with the couch question.  A young woman was very distraught that we didn't come pick up her couches.  I gently explained to her [at 7am] that we could not remove her couches and that I did not know who she could get to remove them.  She was upset because her landlord was upset, she explains.  After a lengthy conversation, her trying to convince me to do something, me trying to convince her that I couldn't, she dropped the bomb.  My phone number was on the side of trash cans everywhere around the city.  YIKES!  That afternoon I convinced the phone company that I desperatly needed a new number, I googled it, and it appeared to be a safe choice.    Moral of the story: Never talk to strangers about trash removal.         "

It's just that I see them as exactly the type of generalization that is emblematic of ignorance.  Is it stereotyping to say that stereotyping of this sort is for morons?  Yes, there are people (of every culture) who are undereducated and say and do ignorant things.  There are folks out there who are not model parents.  But, it seems that they get more attention than they are due.  There are plenty of hard-working Americans who have less but strive for betterment.  The connection that Bill draws between the poor and the ignorant is a bit to cozy for me.  Yes, there are many folks (African Americans among them) who cry discrimination too easily.  But, Bill's statements here can be sloppy to the point that they undermine legitimate claims or get co-opted.  I'm not sure I wouldn't trust an Affirmative Action opponent not to leverage this same argument and cite Bill Cosby as the source.    Also, take special note of Jesse Jackson in the background.

1708471,female,indUnk,"           Cosmopolitan aka The Bible, is genious, pure genious. I've finally upgraded myself from Seventeen and YM to Cosmo, and I love it. This magazine can help you in any situation, and not just sexually. But really if you are embarrassed to ask something to anyone, Cosmo will have all the answers.   Here is some of my favorite advice/learnings of Cosmo's latest issue:  'You know that knee-numbing buzz you get from locking eyes with a hottie across the bar? There's a biological reason for it, according to a study from the Institue of Congnitive Neuroscience at University College London. It found that stealing a stare from an attractive stanger lights up part of the brain that predicts a reward, says Uta Frith, PhD, coauthor of the study. Whether your brain is anticipating 'Mmm... boyfriend material!' or 'Ooh, hot fling tonight!' it's a green-lighting you to indulge in a little fantasy. To feel the spark, position yourself in his natural line of vision, then give him a sexy glance as he catches you laughing with pals.'  This is really genious, and ya now, if you are ever nervous or hesitant to get into a relationship or whatever, look for this sign, and if you get it, you know all is well.   Signs He's Not in the Mood:  -He falls asleep in the middle of a hand job. -You bring home lingerie, and he says, 'Are you sure purple is really your color?' -As you're about to get it on, his mom's number pops up on the caller ID and he actually picks up.   Hmmm there's much more, such as Cosmo telling you how to give a good hand job, and how to find your G-spot. That and Keira Knightley is on the cover, and well ya I love her, if I were gay, ok no scratch that, if I were straight, I'd do her. Hahaha.   Best wishes on your sexual encounters.   k         "

2844168,female,Marketing,"                  The Tropical Adventures of the Fab Four Day #1   I started waking up at 6:30 this morning. I haven't done that since we moved here. We were both excited that Kurt & Michelle were arriving today. When you wake up earlier than the alarm there's always that mental conversation 'I'm awake, do I just get up, or can I ignore it and maybe doze for a little while?' I usually convince myself to doze and this morning was no exception.  We headed downtown and picked Kurt & Michelle up at the airport at 11:00 a.m. Ked headed inside to baggage claim while I stayed and guarded the car from those pesky airport security guys who think every unattended car is a security danger. I watched through the window as Kurt came down the escalator and saw Ked. The look on his face was pure joy and excitement and the brothers gave each other a hearty hug. I smiled and thanked God for the relationship they have and the time we get to spend together. They've both been like little boys all day long, chattering away, making other bodily noises - ahem!, and having a great time. Right now they're outside playing with their cameras in the sunset. (Kurt recently bought the same model that Ked has).  We loaded their stuff in the car and asked them what they would like to do. Since we were already half way to the beach we decided that would be a great way to start the trip! We grabbed some sandwiches at Subway and then headed to Ft DeSoto for a picnic and a few hours of sun and surf. It was an absoulutely gorgeous day, and perfect beach weather! The breeze was slight and the water was calm, clear, and blue. After lathering up with sunscreen we headed into the warm bath-like water with our snorkels to see what we could see. The find of the day was a giant, live sand dollar. He had to be 8 inches in diameter and a few inches thick. We all observed him on the ocean floor and then Kurt picked him up for a closer look. After we huddled around and oohed and aahed over God's creativity, we sent him back to his home. We found some other cool shells and Michelle and I spotted an unusual fish that looked like an eel with a long, needle nose. It was just a gorgeous day to be at the beach!  After a few hours we headed back to our place. After giving a quick tour of the apartment we headed down to the pool to rinse off the sand and saltwater. Ahhh, the life! I whipped up a nice dinner of corn on the cob, burgers, and coleslaw with strawberry shortcake for the dessert. And now I’m blogging, Michelle’s sleeping and the guys are out shooting pictures. It was a great day and the perfect way to start our trip. We’ll all sleep well tonight which is a good thing since tomorrow we are going to Disney World!!!                "

589736,male,Technology,           hmmm....         
3429420,male,Student,"       Unsurprisingly, it is the 14 of june. I have been spending my time most often in Npcc, but many things have past that worthed my attention and pondering.   The Angel Well over my days i must say, i have valued and tried to learn as much as possible. I read the book, Woman can't read maps and men just can't listen. Haha, strange choice ehh? It made me understand the difference between men and woman and why such difference exist, and what we can do to prevent pressing the red button. Now i move on to a new book written by a famous and good writer, R.A Salvatore who wrote many good series. I have only managed to the first book among the hundreds.    Other than that, it has been most satisfying to win another battle against the odds. Perhaps i have played too long and the expierance have been instilled upon me or perhaps my opponent needed more time.  Another attributes which i have gained over the days was being able to control myself over problems and everything. Being composed in difficult or tough situations is a most useful skill. I have to thank warhammer for that...haha  The devil  There are always evil thoughts which sprouted in my youthful mind. Sometimes it pays to heed its call but i must not be misled. Now i realise more that firends are the essential ladder steps to climb to the top. But perhaps it is nothng more than a evil thought. Still it makes sense, other than simple ladder steps friends provide companionship and someone to talk to. Now i must try to get rid of it.Begone creature of hell!  The dark  Since from last week, my good cousin or rather my best friend had left for army. I miss his companionship and a listener for my sorrows and joys, and nevertheless some good laughters.Still i cant change anything it is beyong my capability to prevent it. Though I was glad that he was positive about it instead of frowning.   Npcc has took up most of my time, spending my time sitting on iron steel chairs and listening to chants. Much time is wasted, a good thing is i can practice my body language reading. Managed to read a few but still i'm not very good at it.  The shooting competition was of my msot regret in this past ten days? Yes it was the most regretful thing. I didnt expect that i have enough time, so i didnt aim for the shooting competition. I have only managed to score a score of 93 which was fairly poor although i pass. I didnt try my best was the worst mistake i have commited!Now i truly wish for a time machine.           "
883178,male,Fashion,"            Did you miss me?    1. What food do you like that most people hate?   I like seafood, and though Im not in too much of a minority there, its the only food I can think of that on occasion people will turn their nose up at.  As in ewww how can you EAT that?? when I eat mussels.  Get over it.   2. What food do you hate that most people love?   Eggs (unless they are in chocolate cake), and apparently, Yoplait Whips.    3. What famous person, whom many people may find attractive, is most unappealing to you?   Vin Diesel.  Though I think Im in total agreement with the other Pandys on that.    4. What famous person, whom many people may find unappealing, do you find attractive?   This is a tough one.  I cant think of one I guess I have pretty mainstream tastes.      5. What popular trend baffles you?   Cars that are bigger than houses.  They are very popular at the parking garage here at work.  Dont get it.          "
883178,male,Fashion,            Ow. (Not aow!)

Do people you interact with day to day or family members know about your journal/blog? Why or why not?  I have a t-shirt with our URL written across the front.  I wear it everywhere, I think its helping get the word out.  Either that, or folks are just staring at my chest without going to the site.  That better not be the case.   3. Do you have a theme for your journal/blog?  Yes.  Were egomaniacs who think that our thoughts and activities are of interest to others.   4. What direction would you like to have your journal/blog go in over the next year??  North-northwest.  Hopefully well make it to Alaska by August.   5. Pimp five of your favorite journals/blogs.?

3468570,male,Student,"       Eleven o'clock, night, a hour more to the Ninth Day of the Seventh Month of the Two Thousand and Fourth Year of the Common Era. Perhaps less than an hour maybe. Being doin' nothing for the past three hours, with simply dilly and dally by my side.  I wonder what surprises awaits me tomorrow? Is it just a normal day, a horrid one or one that would be happily unforgettable? Or one that would made me behave in a pussilaneous way? Life is short, so is peace. All the more we should not delay what we deem to do right to the next morning.  Hahahaha....that was so damn philosophical rite? It's so crazy to write in such Shakespearan way. ((But I like 1500s to 1600s England anyway~~)) Thinking back of the history syllabus taken at the A levels, it is clear that this is not the kind of history that I can put my best effort in. The best history would be to study Europe's history beginning from 1453 to 1972. And by the way, the year 1453 is the fall of the last Roman empire or better known as the Byzantine Empire. That's when the fairly modern history of Europe started.  My computer's jammin' up and I have no idea what is causing such a thing. It's either the virus within this computer or the Overnet downloader that I'm using. One thing I would like to use on the computer is to simply take a hammer and slam it down onto my motherboard so that it will 'contain' the problem instantly. But, this is kinda' stupid so I would not do such a crazy and impractical way to solve problems.   Strange...why am I writin' such non-sensical stuff today? Perhaps...the 'whore' element in me is rising up and 'causing Mr Alvin Tan to change into a whore + slut. Okok...maybe I'm thinkin too much. [Quote with courtesy of Miss MJ from YJC.]  Well...what was I supposed to write about then? Hmmm....typed several stupid quizzes given by mu-ryou friends in friendster...which is kinda' corny too. And I wonder why people do not write long blogs too....shouldn't these cyber stuff be rather lengthy too? Good example --> http://xiaxue.blogspot.com/; and I'm so surprised that there are so many people called Alvin Tan...especially of all shape & sizes too.....with courtesy of Google of course, and not forgetting Yahoo! as well.  Okay...too much body fluid is flying out of the giant opening located at the front of my head. It's time to say goodbye....GOODBYE FOR NOW! Wishing myself all the best in the upcoming History Quiz for tommorow~~!!!          "
3022585,female,Education,"       There is the old cliche that music can change your mood in an instant.  Oftentimes, I am the cliche.  Driving in my car a song on the radio will put in the mood for shopping, reading a book, or dancing within the span of 8 minutes.  The emotional hills and valleys that I go through listening to music come up as quickly as the mileposts on the highway.  On Saturdays, when there is work to be done in my apartment, I open the blinds or windows, turn up the radio on an upbeat (usually hip hop) station and get busy.  Choosing one CD to listen during one period of productive time is more difficult.    I have a habit of listening to an album until it is worn out and tired.  I get a new album and listen to it over and over.  I've been known to put certain songs or even the whole CD on repeat for hours.  Because of this, I know every word to albums of bands like U2, Sarah Mclachlan, James, Harry Connick Jr., Billy Brag and Wilco, Michelle Shocked, David Wilcox, Jimmy Buffet, and show tunes like Les Mis and Phantom.  So much useless information floating around my brain taking up space for real knowledge like whom all of my government representatives are and how they vote in their various arenas.  I know that this mind hoarding of information happens to everybody to some degree, but not only do lyrics hide in my long-term memory, but with those lyrics and melodies are visual, olfactory, and textural memories.  Songs, and especially whole albums can bring back days, events, and sometimes-whole years.  Like James 'Laid' CD evokes the memory or Camp Morehead where I was a (non-sailing) counselor for one summer in high school.  I had brought the only CD player for the cabin so I forced the 12-13 year old girls to listen to my brooding British music.  Camp Morehead was dismantled a few years ago and the land sold to people building their dream second homes on the shores of many peoples childhood summers.  I actually hated camp, but every once in a while when I listen to 'Laid' I wish for the slow breeze coming off the Bogue Sound and all the little SunFish sailing in the wind.  There is another CD in my collection that I bought in the Dominican Republic on spring break my last year in college.  A resident of the house my friend and I stayed in played a native Dominican's CD everyday so it became the soundtrack to our visit.  The music is poorly produced and there are barking dogs used as part of the beat on one song, but that CD is probably the best souvenir I've ever gotten from a trip.  Sometimes, in summer, I'll put it on in my car; roll all the windows down and just drive, thinking of the Dominican.  There are many more CDs and even more recollections.  And so all these memories attached to my music cause the choosing of music to listen to at a particular time quite difficult.  There are rows and rows of CDs in my collection that I just can't bring myself to play because friends and trips and times in my life are gone and can't be reclaimed.  Nostalgia is sad state for me and one I only visit when I really miss someone or someplace.  And I'm so thankful when sometimes; somehow with new places and good friends I have the opportunity to attach new memories to the music.            "

883178,male,Fashion,"           A few thoughts on Mariah Carey and the Today show  For those who may not know, Mariah Carey performed live from the Mall o America on the Today show this morning.  Al Roker (yum!) and Matt Lauer (sure) also were at the event.  Sadly, Ann and Katie stayed in New York.  I watched a bit of the show, though I missed the live performance (sniff, sniff).  It was the pope coming to bless the cathedral.  People were kissing Mariahs ass - you would have thought that Bono himself was there!!  Its always a weird thing to see her interact with her fans  Ive never seen someone more condescending, so much so that its painful to watch.  When Matt asked her why she was there to perform she said very sincerely that it was to be with the people.  Ew...  Anyway, its also what people around town (alright, in the elevator and the break room) are talking about.  Its funny that everyone says the EXACT SAME thing  I would have gone to see Matt and Al, but Mariahs not my thing.  And then I think about a rotunda of people chanting MATT. AND. AL!!, MATT. AND. AL!! and then they take the stage, and everyone goes nuts          "
883178,male,Fashion,"            Radiohead Y'all...   Yeah, the new Radiohead album isn't my favorite of theirs, I'll admit.  But damn if it doesn't do something to me!  My first listen I was kind of like 'Okay, I know these guys know what the hell they're doing, but this needs to grow on me, yo.'  And it did.  Like a rash...but one of those rashes you don't mind so much.  You know the kind...  I've lost you, haven't I?  First of all, I'm having a hard time believing anyone could sell  Pablo Honey .  What?  That's like an essential rock album.  Yeah, they played the piss out of 'Creep' on the radio, but still...there's tons and tons of delicious musical nuggets to be ingested.  I can't even imagine the look on the person's face  at the 2nd hand CD store when that album ends up in the 'I-want-to-sell-these pile.'   'What?  You're actually getting rid of this?  For $3?'  To each their own, I guess.  (Panda, you're crazy.  That's all I'm sayin'.)  Like Duf sez:  It's hard to rank these albums.  Each of them is different to me.  Yeah, there are threads of their previous effort woven into each one, but they are definitely stand-alone works that can't be ignored.  Here goes...  1. Kid A 2. OK Computer 3. Pablo Honey 4. Amnesiac 5. Hail To The Thief 6. The Bends  I know, it's probably blasphemy to cite  'The Bends'  as my least favorite, but as mentioned in previous posts (Duf's namely) this isn't to say I think it's a shitty album.  They all get top marks in my book and admittedly, I jumped on the Radiohead bandwagon with  'OK Computer.'   A lot of my rankings have to do with where I was in my life at the time the albums came out.  When I get a new Radiohead CD I tend to listen to it to death and I found myself listening to Kid A probably the most.  Interesting side note: I was planning on writing a book (a mystery/thriller-type) while listening to Radiohead.  I wanted to set kind of a dark, strange tone in my narrative.  I wrote 16 pages of it and thought it sucked.  Oh well, it was worth the try.         "
766556,female,indUnk,"        A toast to optimism... I'll drink to that!  The internet is e x c r u t i a t i n g l y  s l o w  today.  It takes forever for a page to open, so that by the time it does open, I've forgotten why I was going there in the first place.   *bleh*  It's rainy and gray outside again.  Just another day in paradise... NOT!  And, to complete my day, I have the Wine Club Dinner tonight.  The first dinner I've done since last November, which was a great success with 100 guests.  That dinner benefitted the Boys & Girls Club of South Florida.  Tonight's dinner doesn't benefit anyone, not even me considering there are only 14 guests expected.  That's including me, the Wine rep and his guest.  *bleh again*  But, still, it should be a good night - if we don't get rained out.  14 people sitting at one great big table, conversing over glasses of Gloria Ferrer Chardonnay and Carneros Cuvee 1991, whilst nibbling on Roast Capon and Veal Medallions.  Tres yummy.  And the Wine rep will be giving out goodie bags and bottles of wine to take home.  Since there are so few attending, he can do this little extra something special.  So, more is not always better.  And, as always, I am trying to be optimistic and sunny in the face of adversity.  Besides, there's nothing a little good vino can't cure!  Diva out.          "

2948997,female,Student,"       In kindergarten your idea of a good friend was the person who let you have the red crayon when all that was left was the ugly black one.   In first grade your idea of a good friend was the person who went to the bathroom with you and held your hand as you walked through the scary halls.   In second grade your idea of a good friend was the person who helped you stand up to the class bully.   In third grade your idea of a good friend was the person who shared their lunch with you when you forgot yours on the bus.   In fourth grade your idea of a good friend was the person who was willing to switch square dancing partners in gym so you wouldn't have to be stuck do-si-do-ing with Nasty Nick or Smelly Susan.   In fifth grade your idea of a friend was the person who saved a seat on the back of the bus for you.   In sixth grade your idea of a friend was the person who went up to Nick or Susan, your new crush, and asked them to dance with you, so that if they said no you wouldn't have to be embarrassed.   In seventh grade your idea of a friend was the person who let you copy the social studies homework from the night before that you had forgotten.   In eighth grade your idea of a good friend was the person who helped you pack up your stuffed animals and old baseball but didn't laugh at you when you finished and broke out into tears.   In ninth grade your idea of a good friend was the person who would go to a party thrown by a senior so you wouldn't wind up being the only underage person there.   In tenth grade your idea of a good friend was the person who changed their schedule so you would have someone to sit with at lunch.   In eleventh grade your idea of a good friend was the person who gave you rides in their new car, convinced your parents that you shouldn't be grounded, consoled you when you broke up with Nick or Susan, and found you a date to the formal.   In twelfth grade your idea of a good friend was the person who helped you pick out a college/university, assured you that you would get into that college/university, helped you deal with your parents who were having a hard time adjusting to the idea of letting you go...   At graduation your idea of a good fri end was the person who was crying on the inside but managed the biggest smile one could give as they congratulated you.   The summer after twelfth grade your idea of a good friend was the person who helped you clean up the bottles from that party, helped you sneak out of the house when you just couldn't deal with your parents, assured you that now that you and Nick or you and Susan were back together, you could make it through anything, helped you pack up for university and just silently hugged you as you looked through blurry eyes at 18 years of memories you were leaving behind, and finally on those last days of childhood, went out of their way to give you reassurance that you would make it in college as well as you had these past 18 years, and most importantly sent you off to college knowing you were loved.   Now, your idea of a good friend is still the person who gives you the better of the two choices, holds your hand when you're scared, helps you fight off those who try to take advantage of you, thinks of you at times when you are not there, reminds you of what you have forgotten, helps you put the past behind you but understands when you need to hold on to it a little longer, stays with you so that you have confidence, goes out of their way to make time for you, helps you clear up your mistakes, helps you deal with pressure from others, smiles for you when they are sad, helps you become a better person, and most importantly loves you!   Thank you for being a friend. No matter where we go or who we become, never forget who helped us get there.   There's never a wrong time to pick up a phone or send a message telling your friends how much you miss them or how much you love them.   You know who you are, pass it on to someone who you want to remind.   If you love someone, tell them.  Remember always to say what you mean.   Never be afraid to express yourself. Take this opportunity to tell someone what they mean to you. Seize the day and have no regrets.   Most importantly, stay close to your friends and family, for they have helped make you the person that you are today and are what it's all about anyway. Pass this along to your friends. Let it make a difference in your day and theirs.   The difference between expressing love and having regrets is that the regrets may stay around forever.      So what does that make one think? I've never had the same friends for more than three years or known the same people for more than six years. Alot of these memories are foreign to me. Is it because of me? Or is it because of my constant craving of change and mutation? Is there something wrong with me? Am I the kind of person that you only stay friends with for a small portion of time? What about partners? I've never been involved for more than 1 month and 27 days (how sad that I know the exact period) but what is it? I think I associate with a shapeshifter the best. I'm just a constant sneaky backstabbing mutation.   Do I take this email as bogus? or what...do I delete it and say fuck you and fuck you having your friends? No. I decide to dwell and write when I should be doing other fucking constructive things. Oh God. I think tomorrow will be a disaster...I can forsee a trip to the hospital. Jamies on speed dial tomorrow incase I need him to order me some thai to replace the disaster I make. I hate you sometimes Jamie, and yet at others...I dunno.

I have been accused of being brutally honestbut with hair, outfits, etc, I can be like a guy in that I dont notice subtle differences.  Especially with hair colorwhen Thong was still in the office she was getting her hair highlighted at least every 3 weeks (it was gross) and she  always  asked me if I liked it.  Instead of saying yes or no, I usually told her I couldnt tell.  This was true and not too hurtful (?).  I have had some interesting hairdos over the years, and I usually appreciated peoples commentsunless it was some asshole guy telling me they like girls better with long hair.  Those guys can go to hell.   3. Have you ever found out something about a friend and then wished you hadn't? What happened?   A friend once told me how a guy  really  felt about me when we were going out.  This I did  not  need to know.  Does this even answer this question?

766556,female,indUnk,"        And later that day...  I received a call today from the father of my children.  I've decided not to call him 'my ex' since I really don't want any connection to him.  Although, 'my child-support check' would be a nice connection, but that isn't happening any time soon.  So, in all of his unemployed glory, he called today to tell me he wants to take the girls to opening day at The Marlins - that's baseball for the sports-impaired reader.  He's a big baseball fan, and always makes a point to take the girls to a game or two during season.  So, it's opening day and he's going to pick up the girls.  'Okay,' I say.  At least he's doing  something  with them, and that's a good thing.  Funny thing is, when he goes to pick up the oldest diva-ette, she doesn't want to go!  She'd rather stay at the Youth Center with her friends, swimming in the pool.  Ha!  So the littlest diva-ette (who really has no say in the matter) goes off with daddy to see The Marlins.  Maybe my oldest daughter is beginning to grow up a little, and daddy isn't quite so perfect?  Or maybe she just prefers the pool to baseball with daddy.  I must admit I found a great deal of satisfaction in this little turn of events, no matter what the cause.  Petty perhaps, but I got a good little snicker out of it nonetheless.  As I've said before, I'm a simple girl with simple needs.  It doesn't take much to make me happy. *grin*  Diva out.          "
649790,female,indUnk,"               Regret   Ever had one of those moments where you coulda shoulda woulda done something if you weren't frozen by nervousness or inertia? One of those moments where you miss an opportunity and it  never really quite comes round again?  Today one of the vendors for The Big Issue came up the tram. He was a well-built old man, his face tan and leathery, his hair silver, and each of the many wrinkles on his gruff visage told of the things he had seen and done. He stood tall, proud, save for a scruffy grey sweater that had seen better days, and a Big Issue vest and sling bag, both worn at the edges.  He sat on the seat in front of me, facing the lady on my left. I stole a quick peek at the cover - a smiling Rachel Griffiths next to a headline for Six Feet Under. I averted my eyes - I didn't feel like buying a copy. True, the money went to a good cause - the magazine employed the homeless to raise funds for the homeless, helping them get back on their feet. But except for the 5 copies I bought last year, when the idea of giving back to society in such a convenient way was still a novel idea, I hadn't approached a vendor to buy one since; I didn't have time to read anyway.  'Are you a Rachel Griffiths fan, young lady?' said the old man to a pony-tailed woman who'd just come up the tram. She just smiled and shook her head.  'You know why I'm asking don't you? he pressed on, the magazine in his hand, a wry smile on his lips. She smiled and nodded, then turned away. 'Yeah, not much of a fan myself, just like the photographs,' he said, smiling to himself, as he twisted the magazine in his hand.  'Are you a Rachel Griffiths fan?' he asked the bespectacled teenage boy that came up next. 'No,' he replied simply.  'Are you a Rachel Griffiths fan?' he asked the lady sitting across the aisle. She shook her head, too absorbed in her own thoughts.  'Are you a Rachel Griffiths fan?' he asked the lady next to me. I looked down at my shoes, then stared straight ahead. He didn't bother asking me.  He got off the tram at the next stop. My heart was pounding, my head was screaming. I should have done something. I could have bought a copy. He'd just fallen on tough times. He could be someone's father, someone's grandfather. He could have saved lives. I could have invited him back for a cuppa, we could have talked. We would both have made a new friend.  I looked out the window, and saw him cross the road to Flinders Street Station. He stood outside in the cold, wrapped in his grey sweater, holding The Big Issue, smoking a cigarette.  The tram moved off. I opened my bag, and saw my wallet. I took it out, looked through, saw that I had a ten-dollar bill, and a five-dollar one.   I could have bought a copy. But I didn't. I was afraid. I was ashamed.   19 August 2002             "

4192173,male,Technology,"             I write this with a headache a mile wide, so bear with me. With Irene off on a girls night (which I'm told was quite hilarious), I made my way back to the studio to with the intention to remix Saintface and work on a song Brandt's had cooking for quite a while now called BITTER PARTY OF ONE (That title won't last, I promise). However, Ash decided he had to buy his cats gourmet dried fish, so he wasn't going to make, thus that meant no remixing as he had the Face parts. Rrrrr. Thus, we decided to work on the new song..  It took Brandt FOREVER to load this song and all the parts up and I was bored out of my freakin' mind. When he did get the song up, I have to admit I wasnt nearly as pleased with the track as I was when I heard it many weeks back. So a lot of deconstructing went on. The first thing to go were Brandt's strings, which sounded way the hell too much like TKK. Brandt let his Wax Trax fascination get the best of him with this song. I had played some bass awhile back which I thought blew, so I spent a lot of time writing new parts. This took a long time, but I was able to write basslines for the verses and choruses, though the chourses went through a few revisions as the day went on.  At some point during all this, Brandt received a phone call from Ash, saying he was coming by 'in a half hour' to drop off the remix parts and I received a phone call from my old pal Jamie Duffy (on tour doing sound for Saves The Day) saying he also was coming by 'in a half hour'. Its interesting to see what 'in a half hour' means for these guys as they didnt show until many half hours later, and hours apart from each other.  Anyway, there was no way Jamie was going to hang out with us and not play, so after he spent 3 hours Instant Messaging people, we put a guitar in his hand and DAMN did he take this new track to the next level. He played the most UN-Jamie like guitars I have ever heard (I mean this in a good way). He played some 12 string as well as some E-bow and really added some sexiness to the track. I just left him and Brandt alone to make this track happen. Now the song went from Wax Traxy to sounding like Soda Stereo. This is good. Damn good.  Then it became the industrial This Is Your Life as the three of us had a big dinner discussing everything under the sun about Jamie's and my past in the world of machine rock (as we call it now). Some funny stories were told and I think Brandt got a kick out of hearing a lot of the behind the scenes stuff that has happened to us over the years.  And yes, Jamie confirmed the atrocity that was the aggression hotel destruction incident. Brandt was shocked that that story was NOT exaggerated.  Then it was drinks long into the evening at KGB bar, which was a good choice as the drinks are strong and priced reasonably and the place isnt overcrowded. Like Russia. I think.  All in all, a fun evening. Thanks, Kid!  F         "

4192173,male,Technology,"             Last night, at a hotel in lower Manhattan, I met the man who influenced me to pick up a bass guitar when I FIRST met him 12 years ago. It's no secret here who this person is, but needless to say he was a total gentleman who was funny and sweet. This brief conversation totally justified my musical existance. We discussed Hypefactor, bass playing and Gibson Thunderbirds. When he asked for a CD, I was floored. Kudos go to Irene (for giving me the last copy of Distracted Lover we had in the house, so I didnt have to rip down my framed copy), G (for coming along so I didn't look like a stalker), and B (tipping me off about the DJ set).

766556,female,indUnk,"       Not going to dwell on what i've done... just forging ahead blindly into the possibilities. But there is hope, as he is thinking about me still.  I wanted to comment on a funny coincidence that has given me a strange perspective into a stranger's life.  a neighbor's life actually.  5 or 6 years ago, a guy tried to pick me up in a club.  He gave me his number but i left it at the bar and never called him.    I actually saw him at a few other places around town, always with a group of friends - apparently we liked the same places.  He didn't seem to remember or recognize me, and I never tried to say hello.  Now, it turns out that when I moved into my new apartment in January, I moved into HIS building.  We really do like the same places.  But being his neighbor has afforded me a greater insight into this man's life - and on a greater scale, I think into the lives of many people just like him. Young, professional, sufficiently successful, and single.  I know what car he drives - by seeing him parking in the garage one day.  I know he lives on the 23rd floor of my building, since we ride in the elevator together frequently.  He leaves for work at 8:30 and gets home around 7pm.  I've even seen him walking out of the 'gentleman's club' around the corner from our building.    And finally, I've seen him with maybe 2 different women - so i've seen his taste in women too.   It's strange and deep in my heart it makes me a little sad, because I see this man's solitary life and some of its private details.  I sometimes wonder how it feels to be him - solitary -- no children, no wife.  I wonder if he's happy living alone.  Maybe he has a pet, but I've never seen him walking a dog... a cat maybe?    So many of us walk together, live together and are so alone.  We think that no one knows our sorrow or cares; we are all looking for something more.    I've still never really said hello to him.  I have no interest in really getting to know him, although he may be a very nice person.  It may be cowardice, but I'm just happy knowing his secrets.  And in some small way this makes me feel more connected to the world as a whole - it reminds me that we are all the same, we come from the same source and we are all one.         "

589736,male,Technology,"           from a  urlLink transcript  of the interview with Diane Sawyer that JLS mentioned earlier:   Bush also defended the intelligence that he used in citing weapons of mass destruction in Iraq as a main reason for going to war. Asked about the emphasis now on alleged weapons 'programs' instead on possession of weapons themselves, Bush remained firm about his prewar assessment of the threat Saddam posed and insisted the world and America are safer because of the war that toppled him.   ' What's the difference? ' he said. 'If he were to acquire weapons, he would be the danger. That's what I'm trying to explain to you. A gathering threat, after 9-11, is a threat that needed to be dealt with.'    ...i guess the difference that immediately comes to mind would be the one between 1) telling the truth  and 2) lying.    what the fuck, bush?  is  that  the administration's answer to why we haven't found any weapons of mass destruction in Iraq?  that you figured we'd understand that when you  urlLink said  right before the war, 'The dictator of Iraq and his weapons of mass destruction are a threat to the security of free nations',  what you *meant* was, 'The dictator of Iraq is  planning  on producing weapons of mass destruction at some point in future, which  at that time  will be a threat to the security of free nations?'  added bonus: he managed to drop a 9-11 reference into a discussion about the justification for invading Iraq.    dammit to hell; enough of this.  i never expected to agree with the bush administration's policies, but the very least they could do is be straightforward with the people who pay their salaries.

Of course Mr. Sweet arrived to give his condolences and offered to sing his song Ive Been Waiting, because weve all been waiting; waiting for something, whether it be a post from an old friend, a long overdue visit to Chicago, that burrito at Chipotle, Liz Phairs new album, or just a nice warm day (for a change).

883178,male,Fashion,"            Everyone Wants to Be Found   BB, I happened to catch that one a couple weeks ago.  Bill Murray may get an Academy Award for this film since he didn't get one for  Rushmore ...but his humor came through differently here than in his other movies.  He perfected his sarcastic-lounge-singer-shtick on SNL, however during the most memorable scene of  Lost in Translation , he sings a karaoke version of 'More Than This' with absolutely no condescencion.  The electric chemistry between Scarlett Johansson's character and Murray's is also cemented during this scene.  No doubt, anyone who sees this film will get lost in it.  On a very different side of things, I saw  urlLink The Magdalene Sisters  last weekend.  This movie is a fierce expose of Ireland's Magdalene laundries (which detained more than 30,000 morally 'wayward' women to labor indefinitely in convent purgatories, until the last was shut down in 1996).  There were some horrific scenes in this movie that were just inexcuseable, driving home the director's obvious anger over this shameful blight in the Church's history.  My feeling upon leaving the theater: sadness and a contempt towards the religious figures of my own faith that could have allowed this to happen.  But this sort of thing has happened throughout history - women being proscecuted for being 'temptresses' to men.  Maybe it's not the religion that's to blame; perhaps we should blame the men (and women) who went along with it without questioning their own moral implications.  One movie you should NOT go see:  urlLink Once Upon a Time in the Midlands .  It's slow and not funny.  Not even worth reviewing.           "

No, I think I'd have the kind of restaurant that doesn't have any sort of seafood, white sauce, mushrooms or anything else that I don't like in it.

Sure they're helpful, but maybe a little too over-zealous in getting it all unpacked right away.  2 problems I encountered: 1) Mom & Dad unpacked my entire kitchen and it took me a good week to find out where everything was.  I couldn't eat cereal for a couple days because I couldn't find my bowls.  2) I let Mom unpack my books, and she found  urlLink this .  Since my mom would  never  believe that her little angel would buy such a thing on her own, I just blamed it on my crazy Minnesota friends, telling her it was bought for me as a 'gag gift'.  Sorry HAL and BB.  I panicked and sold you down the river.           "

This is pointless and boring and stupid. Why would I bother posting this.  History! It's fascinating to see an artist struggle and of course I use artist in the 'stupid wanker whining about his feelings' sense.  Is there value in doing this? Value in forcing myself to do it. It gets easier. I can remember when it was easy. Maybe I should set myself a word count. I've gone off the stream a bit. That's ok. It's easier to write maybe it's easier if I just type what I'm thinking and not try to write. I talk to myself constantly. Writing could just be typing down what I'm saying.   So what would I say about myself, in response to a question of why do you want to study here? Well first of course is that I love to study. I really miss being away from school. I still look forward to that first day when everything's new. So really I want to come and study here for the sake of studying.      "

589736,male,Technology,"           Kafka in Tulia By BOB HERBERT   ulia is a hot, dusty town of 5,000 on the Texas Panhandle, about 50 miles south of Amarillo. For some, it's a frightening place, slow and bigoted and bizarre. Kafka could have had a field day with Tulia. On the morning of July 23, 1999, law enforcement officers fanned out and arrested more than 10 percent of Tulia's tiny African-American population. Also arrested were a handful of whites who had relationships with blacks. The humiliating roundup was intensely covered by the local media, which had been tipped off in advance. Men and women, bewildered and unkempt, were paraded before TV cameras and featured prominently on the evening news. They were drug traffickers, one and all, said the sheriff, a not particularly bright Tulia bulb named Larry Stewart. Among the 46 so-called traffickers were a pig farmer, a forklift operator and a number of ordinary young women with children. If these were major cocaine dealers, as alleged, they were among the oddest in the U.S. None of them had any money to speak of. And when they were arrested, they didn't have any cocaine. No drugs, money or weapons were recovered during the surprise roundup. Most of Tulia's white residents applauded the arrests, and the local newspapers were all but giddy with their editorial approval. The first convictions came quickly, and the sentences left the town's black residents aghast. One of the few white defendants, a man who happened to have a mixed-race child, was sentenced to more than 300 years in prison. The hog farmer, a black man in his late 50's named Joe Moore, was sentenced to 90 years. Kareem White, a 24-year-old black man, was sentenced to 60 years. And so on. When the defendants awaiting trial saw this extreme sentencing trend, they began scrambling to plead guilty in exchange for lighter sentences. These ranged from 18 years in prison to, in some case, just probation. It is not an overstatement to describe the arrests in Tulia as an atrocity. The entire operation was the work of a single police officer who claimed to have conducted an 18-month undercover operation. The arrests were made solely on the word of this officer, Tom Coleman, a white man with a wretched work history, who routinely referred to black people as 'niggers' and who frequently found himself in trouble with the law. Mr. Coleman's alleged undercover operation was ridiculous. There were no other police officers to corroborate his activities. He did not wear a wire or conduct any video surveillance. And he did not keep detailed records of his alleged drug buys. He said he sometimes wrote such important information as the names of suspects and the dates of transactions on his leg. In trial after trial, prosecutors put Mr. Coleman on the witness stand and his uncorroborated, unsubstantiated testimony was enough to send people to prison for decades. In some instances, lawyers have been able to show that there was no basis in fact  none at all  for Mr. Coleman's allegations, that they came from some realm other than reality. He said, for example, that he had purchased drugs from a woman named Tonya White, and she was duly charged. But last April the charges had to be dropped when Ms. White's lawyers proved that she had cashed a check in Oklahoma City at the time that she was supposed to have been selling drugs to Mr. Coleman in Tulia. Another defendant, Billy Don Wafer, was able to prove  through employee time sheets and his boss's testimony  that he was working at the time he was alleged by Mr. Coleman to have been selling cocaine. And the local district attorney, Terry McEachern, had to dismiss the case against a man named Yul Bryant after it was learned that Mr. Coleman had described him as a tall black man with bushy hair. Mr. Bryant was 5-foot-6 and bald. In a just world, this case would be no more than a spoof on 'Saturday Night Live.' Instead it's a tragedy with no remedy in sight. The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the William Moses Kunstler Fund for Racial Justice, the Tulia Legal Defense Project and a number of private law firms are trying to mount an effort to free the men and women imprisoned in this fiasco. The idea that people could be rounded up and sent away for what are effectively lifetime terms solely on the word of a police officer like Tom Coleman is insane.             "

Foriegn leaves skittered after her, pushing her further away from their familiar habitat, chasing her to the border of her own world. Falling - to her inexorable melancholy bare-existance.  She'd like to see the arrow splintered in his pulse, she'd like to see his eyes flood with lies. Drawing in. Sucking; bleeding; watching you gasping. A little smile plays upon her lips, her eyes excitedly wide - they narrow again, as her fingers step to a lament only she can hear, echoing throughout her hollow mind.  Numb. Entrapt in this bitter wind.  Kneeling down in the dirt, one long nail traces a symbol. Lifting a blue teardrop from beneath small lashes - it's blessed. Rising, dizzy with energy, she falters, regains control, she holds the chains now.  She binds and sways the wind to her desire, encircling her 'til she cannot breathe. She'll take your breath with her instead.  &nbsp; blah blah blah, *skins herself n hangs it up to dry* 'take me down to the paradise city where the grass is green n the girls are pretty* wow i hav so much to say xBWx :( &nbsp;       "

It was my first wedding of this faith, and it was nice.  I was a little surprised when the Rabbi starting singing, with three little old men as back up singers to his right.    I probably would have enjoyed the ceremony more had it not been completely in French.  And i got there about 45 minutes late.  It took two hours to trek over to Hialeah to drop off the girls at grandma's house.    But, I had fun at the reception.  I danced the hourah (i know i misspelled that one!) and watched as my friend, the bride, was lifted high above everyone's heads in the 'chair of honor'.  And there was a great mix of American and French music over several decades.  I danced, I ate, I laughed.    Going home afterwards was not fun.   I got stopped about a block from my house since the lights on the left side of my car don't work.  I don't know why, they just don't.  After informing me of all my faults, and asking if my children are buckled up, he ran my license and found that I'm an honest citizen.  He let me go home, telling me to get my lights fixed.

3869393,female,Technology,"       Quite interesting how the blogs are now becoming a mode of communication...a simple tool with which someone is able to express their feelings and add clarity to their lives...  Yet again, I had problems posting stuff on someone's comments page, I thought okay, anyway I need to update my blog, so why not address certain issues in this ....  1.&nbsp; Temple visiting bringing peace: anything with god for a truly religious person, will bring peace to one's heart to a good extent.&nbsp; But there is a&nbsp; saying that God helps only those who help themselves.&nbsp; One needs to truly believe in their heart and mind, that they can find peace, only then will they ever get close to that.  2.&nbsp; Trying to mend fences : well, this is something which I can do if I had a reason to do so, but right now I see no rhyme or reasoning coming from the other side of the fence to mend this.&nbsp; Anyway, as said by someone some time ago, certain lessons learnt can cause a lot of pain and grief to people, and trying to implement the changes will only make others experience more pain and misery.&nbsp; This is somethign which I dont think certain people are upto to facing up to!  3.&nbsp; Moving on in life : Its' just a process, one needs to try to take an initiative towards moving on in life, you cant wait for life to thrust something onto you to make your life.&nbsp; Unlike someone, I aint got people hounding them with horoscopes, photos of puny & cute women, ads, trips, training, etc, all I have is my work, workout at the club, trips out of chennai and my music.&nbsp; I am trying to find solace in this and am quite aware that this is going to be long process, but I need to make an effort towards this, coz I cant run away from this!  4.&nbsp; Memories : For someone who has been in love, that too true love, its far too tough and also not exactly humanly possible to forget these good memories. If one is able to forget these memories, it only shows the commitment they had to the relationship.&nbsp;   Today, after nearly 7 years, I went back to the swimming pool, was shit scared to get in, and felt oh my, I might just drown if I get into the deep end.&nbsp; This was the thought which was ringing in my head from my office to before changing at swimming pool dressing room.&nbsp; As I was changing, I began to wonder, hmm, I have swam before, learnt the art well enough, yeah I lost touch, so , does that mean I will drown if I set foot in the water...???&nbsp;&nbsp; I then decided, no more idiotic thoughts in my head, I will get into the deep end and swim across to the shallow end and back.&nbsp; In addition to this fear, I had this fear that, oh my what if I look depressing in my swim suit and people give me the stares.&nbsp; Another stupid thought which just filled my head, which I simply decided to overcome, and yes, I did check things out in the mirror before I got into the pool...geez I wasnt exactly a hippo and more than anything I believed in myself that I was taking steps to drop my weight, and this was good for me, so no use running away from it.&nbsp; Got into the pool, had a shaky start, had a little tough time getting to the other end, but within 10 minutes I was back to normalcy and could feel my body moving like a fish.&nbsp; How did this come, simple, coz I believe that my heart and mind are co operating with me, and also feel that I am doing the right thing, and nothing wrong at all!  Life is about choices, the choices we make may appear to make or break our lives, but usually the choices we turn down find a way of coming back to us later on in life, in a differnt wrapper....its' just the way you see life!&nbsp;   Wear your belief on your shoulder, trust yourself and you'll realise the world has a lot to offer, and there are a zillion people around you wanting to know you more!

3359005,male,Student,"             By  Ethan Alter   There's one thing you can say for sure about Bob and Joyce: These senior citizens definitely don't look like your typical Internet-dating couple. Still, the latest team to face Philimination on CBS's The Amazing Race (Tuesdays, 10pm/ET) was also one of the most popular thanks to their upbeat attitudes, strong racing skills and all-around good-heartedness. Here the New Jersey natives reminisce about their first date, and look ahead to the future.    Ethan: So tell us the story of how you met.    Joyce:  We met through Match.com. I had been a widow for a long time and didn't have much of a personal life. I was raising my three children and working hard. My son, who is a software engineer, told me, 'Mom, you need a life. Go on the Internet. It's the only way you'll be able to do this.' And I said, 'No way.' But he insisted and helped me put my profile on Match.com. Lo and behold, Bob came on...   Bob:  And I saw her profile. Actually, I passed over it several times because she looked like a girly girl and I was looking for someone who liked outdoor things. But one day, I read her profile and it said she likes outdoor activities. So I sent her an e-mail and the rest is history.   Joyce:  For our first date, we had drinks at a local restaurant. Afterwards, Bob walked me to my car and when I got in, I thought, 'Yes!'   Bob:  I got back home that night and my daughter walked in. She knew I had had several dates on the Internet and so she asked, 'Well, how'd this one go?' And I said, 'This one went really well.'   Joyce:  We knew immediately that this was going to be a long-term thing. The race just sealed it.   Ethan: Whose idea was it to apply for TAR?    Bob:  [Raising his hand] I was a fan of the show and, actually, I was already planning to do it with my brother-in-law. My hook was 'Meet two brothers-in-law who actually get along.' But then, I met Joyce and thought, 'This will be a lot more fun.' I knew she would go along with the application and I knew we were going to get picked. Two widowed people who met on the Internet and are active — we've got a few things going. Joyce didn't think so. Then we were picked.   Joyce:  And I was like, 'I really have to do this now! What in the world did I get myself in to?' But I would do it again in a heartbeat, as long as I didn't have to eat any more caviar!   Ethan: Yeah, that caviar challenge looked positively brutal.    Joyce:  It was awful! We had already decided that I was going to do all the eating challenges because I eat virtually anything, and I do love caviar. But when I saw the amount of caviar, I was shocked! When I first started eating it, I was like, 'Okay, this is gross, but I can eat it.' But after a while you felt like you just had to throw up.   Ethan: Since you're both so Internet savvy, are you thinking of putting up your own website after the show is over?    Bob:  I don't know. It would be nice to hear 'Hey Bob and Joyce, I took your advice and I met someone.' That's part of our story. We hope we can encourage people to take a chance and get out there and try again. Maybe they can be as lucky as we were.   Joyce:  I would like to do that, if only to give people like us a means of support. If you are widowed or divorced, it doesn't make a difference how old you are. Put yourself out there. Take a chance. Every day is another experience. I tell my children this all the time: 'Do something every day that scares you and you always will remain fresh.' Bob laughed at me when I first told him that.   Bob:  I had heard to do something that scares you every once in a while, not every day.   Joyce:  Every day!   Ethan: Knowing what you know now, what would you do differently if you ran the race over again?    Bob:  We'd probably try to work with the other teams a little bit more. Also, don't always believe the information you're given. Double-check and triple-check everything.   Joyce:  Definitely stay connected to the other teams more; you never know what you can pick up. And the teams that are racing are very smart. It's so nice to see young people with so much intuition and the absolute moxie to put themselves out there and work it.   Bob: Overall, we're happy with the way we ran the race. We didn't want to screw anybody over or embarrass our children or ourselves. We knew we had a life to come back to after this — that was always in the back of our minds. We felt real good about doing the race the way we wanted to do it. And I think we had more fun than most people!   Joyce:  Because of this experience, Bob and I are going to backpack in Greece next year. You can go anywhere in this world — you don't need a tour and you don't need luggage. You can carry everything you need on your back.   Ethan: So now that you've survived the race together, have you taken the next step?    Bob:  We're not engaged yet, but we're confident that we have met the partner we want to spend the rest of our lives with. We're taking it a day at a time. This is real.   Joyce:  This is for real. We'll be together. He knows that and I know that about him. What will follow will follow, and we'll just take each day as it comes. I always said I don't need $1 million, because $1 million is fleeting. I got the biggest prize of all: I got Bob. It sounds corny, but it's true.           "
3511107,female,Education,"                 Concerned for the Future By Sandy Escobedo January 10, 2004, 1:19am New York, NY  As I sit here and read through endless articles on Latino experiences coming particularly from those who are from LA, I can’t help but wonder, how “Latino” are my kids going to be?  I ask myself this because I am presently coping with the confusion one encounters when your passport reads “U.S. Citizen”, your parents are immigrants from Mexico and El Salvador, and you were born and raised in SOUTH EAST-LA, a part of LA that isn’t acknowledged enough.  Becoming cognizant of our multiple identities is both a blessing and a curse.  It is the complexity of our identity that makes us more interesting individuals, but it is that same complexity that makes it difficult for others to decipher who we are.  And when I say others, I mean everyone, especially we as “Latinos.”   Like many “enlightened” Latinos, I had the privilege of receiving a college education.  I recently graduated from UCSB with a degree in Art History and two minors in French and History.  Because of my major, I had the opportunity to study abroad in Bordeaux France for a year and intern at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.  It is through these experiences as well as the course work I took that I formulated ideas on who I was.  I took a Chicano Studies class and found myself wondering whether I was a Chicana or not.  I sometimes I felt obligated to consider myself Chicana because I knew the flaws associated with the terms “Hispanic” and “Latino.”  Honestly though, I felt more comfortable, and in some way prefer the term Latino over Chicano.  My reasons are entirely personal and in no way would I want to impose my preferences and biases on others. I don’t consider myself Chicana because I don’t relate to what I SEE associated with Chicanismo.  I see Chicanismo, in context to LA, as associated with second or third generation Mexicans that were once from EAST LA who don’t speak Spanish and are too distant from being “Mexican.”  First and foremost, the immigration experience of my parents is recent and it is different from the families of self-proclaimed Chicanos.  My parents came to the U.S. in 1979; my dad from Mexico fleeing poverty, my mother from El Salvador fleeing the beginnings of the civil war.  My parents never worked in a field.  In fact, I had never seen farm labor until I encountered it on the 101 ventura freeway on my way to UCSB.  My parents instead began their life here in the service sector and now work in unionized jobs in which my dad earns a middle-class salary by working 12 hour shifts, at times, 7 days a week.   In other words, my parents are an example of meritocracy.  However, I understand that my parents have lucked out; they don’t.  They view that our success is attributed to all our hard work or as they would say “Bendiciones de Dios.” What they fail to see is that not every one with their background will achieve the so-called American Dream.  And because of this, my father nags at me all the time because I should be proud and not ashamed of being born in this country.  Thinking that I know it all, I just comfort myself by seeing him as a concerned parent.  Then I think about the future, and my own kids.   For me, it is a must that my children speak Spanish.  It is a must that my children are advocates for social justice.  And most importantly, it is a must that they recognize that their socio-economic privilege is the result of their grand-parents “illegally” crossing the border to hustle in this country in give me a chance to reach my full potential.  And I fear that not happening and I fear viewing myself as a bad parent as a result of it.  But at the same time, is it fair for me to burden my children with such expectations knowing that they will be inevitably distant from my paisa experience no matter how much I try to imbed them in it?

This is what I wrote:  I just had a bag of Born (and Baked) in the USA snack cookies, and they were delicious.  I actually shared them with some co-workers (keeping my calories down, you know) and we all liked them a lot.  We had a disagreement about whether the hats were separate or if they just broke off from the Uncle Sam cookies.  Could you settle this for us?  I think that the hats come separately.  Also, and this is unrelated, but we were thinking that since America is one nation under God, it might be a good idea to do a line of religious cookies.  We thought you could incorporate some images of our Lord, like Jesus, sandles, fish, wine and a crucifix.  Just an idea.  Thanks and best wishes with your cookies.

3568056,male,Sports-Recreation,"           yes, this means that i am back home again.  actually we got back saturday night, but i have been pretty busy.  the trip was awesome.  the only other times i have been to chicago (twice) were just connector flights through o'hare, so this was the first time i had seen the city.  we stayed downtown, so we walked around the lake shore park area, which was beautiful.  unfortunately, the traffic was terrible (worse than nyc, imo, i have heard that la traffic is worse...i really pity them if it is), so everything like the museums and shedd aquarium was closed.  the next day (friday) we went to visit campus.  i loved u chicago.  it just felt like they had the same sort of priorities that i would want (they also seemed proud that theyre the only school undefeated vs. notre dame in football...yeah, 1-0 or something).  the campus was beautiful too.  i think it is probably in my top 3 schools now (yale, william and mary), plus its a little easier to get into.  i was surprised at how seriously chicago took its baseball.  the city series (cubs/sox) was starting up the day we left, so that probably contributed, but the obsession was nearing the ohio state football level in columbus (an inascertainable level, the benchmark of all irrational obsessions i would say...although not a bad one by any means).  i think i could live in a city like that. after the visit, we drove to st louis friday night.  our hotel room was upgraded to a vip suite...we were the 'customer of the day'...not sure what that is all about, but the room was cool.  we ate at j bucks in clayton (suburb), where i realized that st louis was probably as into sports as chicago.  i guess that there isnt much else in the midwest that we are so narrow-minded.  anyway, saturday morning we visited wustl, which i liked, not as much as uc, but it seemed to be a place i wouldnt mind going to.  i think i will apply there too. we got back saturday night so i would have time to go to a meeting sunday morning for camp counselors for a camp i am helping with at my church.  i get to be with 3rd grade boys for a week (july 6-10 i think).  it will be interesting to say the least.  i am looking forward to it. this morning i had my first tournament of the yr.  i was gang-raped by mosquitoes early on, so i am trying to move as little as possible now.  i overcame them to an extent, and i ended up shooting 89.  while that sounds terrible, i actually played very well, i just had 3 bad holes (2 triple-bogeys and a quad).  if you take those away it was a decent round, plus the course was tough and i hadnt played it before.  i tied for 2nd in the tournament (that should give you an idea of how 'strong' the league is-86 won it).  the group i played in was pretty bad.  on one whole we lost 8 balls (as a foursome).  the other kids kept having to go back and re-hit from the tee.  i just sat on the ground and waited, then i started cracking up...kind of like the judges on american idol during auditions.  i felt mean, but i couldnt help it.  the kids behind us were getting pretty mad, which was probably the funniest part.  they hit into us a couple of times...you have to find humor in these things i guess.  there were scores of 12 and 10 on that hole (and they both kind of cheated, but i felt bad for them).  in case youre wondering, i lost a ball but still made bogey-6 (it would have been a birdie if i hadnt lost a ball) so ha. i believe i am going to go see spiderman 2 wednesday night.  brad picked up a bunch of tickets, so hopefully everyone will be early so i dont have to sit in the aisle again (see dodgeball post).  i should probably rent the 1st spiderman since i still havent seen it.  i think thats all i have to say...this is a pretty long post, congrats if you made it all the way here:) the end.

883178,male,Fashion,"            Room on Fire, Reviewed  By Duf Fer  I got the new Strokes album, 'Room on Fire,' yesterday (its release date), and it is very darn good.  I don't think it is as commercially viable as their debut 'Is This It?', but it is an impressive work.    In my view, their technical skills are neither diminshed nor improved.  They can still rock out, but they don't bring as much energy to the songs here as in the debut.  I think this is intentional.  They are quieting things down a bit, and just as 'Is This It' was a throwback to classic American Rock and Roll, this new piece is an extension with the lights adjusted to effect a different mood.    The opening track 'What Ever Happened?'  Seems like a VH1 joke disguised as a love song and is clearly the high point on the disc.  'I want to be forgotten, and I don't want to be reminded...'  The low point?  There really isn't one.    'Between Love and Hate' is another favorite.  Overall 'Room on Fire' is a solid effort that does not topple the primacy or primal-cy of their original effort but establishes The Strokes as a band with its own distinct and wonderful sound and furthers their effort to resurrect pure American rock-and-roll.

3022585,female,Education,"       Yesterday, the phone rang while I was brushing my teeth.  Mouth full or foam and sonic still buzzing, I run around looking for my cell phone.  When I locate it deep in the depths of my purse I don’t recognize the number and think that I need to answer it quickly.   And then, like a dumbass, I do.  My muffled “hello” allows the person on the other end to identify himself.  While he does so I’m thinking “What do I do now?  I can’t talk like this.  Do I swallow it (ew) or spit while he’s on the phone.  What. The. Hell?”  I decide on spitting and just confess it, he’s already heard me sound as if I’m under water.  So I say “Hold on, I’m brushing my teeth,” then go to the sink to spit, sonic turned off but still in my hand.  I apologize to him when I return and hope that he didn’t hear me spitting in the sink, 3 feet away from the phone.  I realize; what a dumbass, like answering the phone at that moment was so important that it superseded the mouth full of water and paste.  What, what was I thinking?  Sometimes, I wonder.         "

589736,male,Technology,"            The Architect  - Hello, Neo.   Neo  - Who are you?   The Architect  - I am the Architect. I created the matrix. I've been waiting for you. You have many questions, and although the process has altered your consciousness, you remain irrevocably human. Ergo, some of my answers you will understand, and some of them you will not. Concordantly, while your first question may be the most pertinent, you may or may not realize it is also irrelevant.   Neo  - Why am I here?   The Architect  - Your life is the sum of a remainder of an unbalanced equation inherent to the programming of the matrix. You are the eventuality of an anomaly, which despite my sincerest efforts I have been unable to eliminate from what is otherwise a harmony of mathematical precision. While it remains a burden to sedulously avoid it, it is not unexpected, and thus not beyond a measure of control. Which has led you, inexorably, here.   Neo  - You haven't answered my question.   The Architect  - Quite right. Interesting. That was quicker than the others.  *The responses of the other Ones appear on the monitors*  Others?  What others?  How many?  Answer me!'    The Architect  - The matrix is older than you know. I prefer counting from the emergence of one integral anomaly to the emergence of the next, in which case this is the sixth version.  *Again, the responses of the other Ones appear on the monitors*   Five versions?   Three?   I've been lied too.   This is bullshit!    Neo : There are only two possible explanations: either no one told me, or no one knows.   The Architect  - Precisely. As you are undoubtedly gathering, the anomaly is systemic, creating fluctuations in even the most simplistic equations.  *Once again, the responses of the other Ones appear on the monitors*   You can't control me! Fuck you!  I'm going to kill you!  You can't make me do anything!    Neo  - Choice. The problem is choice.  * The scene cuts to Trinity fighting an agent, and then back to the Architect's room *   The Architect  - The first matrix I designed was quite naturally perfect. It was a work of art, flawless, sublime.  A triumph equaled only by its monumental failure. The inevitability of its doom is as apparent to me now as a consequence of the imperfection inherent in every human being. Thus, I redesigned it based on your history to more accurately reflect the varying grotesqueries of your nature.   However, I was again frustrated by failure. I have since come to understand that the answer eluded me because it required a lesser mind, or perhaps a mind less bound by the parameters of perfection. Thus, the answer was stumbled upon by another, an intuitive program, initially created to investigate certain aspects of the human psyche. If I am the father of the matrix, she would undoubtedly be its mother.   Neo  - The Oracle.   The Architect  - Please. As I was saying, she stumbled upon a solution whereby nearly 99.9% of all test subjects accepted the program, as long as they were given a choice, even if they were only aware of the choice at a near unconscious level. While this answer functioned, it was obviously fundamentally flawed, thus creating the otherwise contradictory systemic anomaly, that if left unchecked might threaten the system itself. Ergo, those that refused the program, while a minority, if unchecked would constitute an escalating probability of disaster.   Neo  - This is about Zion.   The Architect  - You are here because Zion is about to be destroyed. Its every living inhabitant terminated, its entire existence eradicated.   Neo  - Bullshit.  *The responses of the other Ones appear on the monitors*   Bullshit!    The Architect  - Denial is the most predictable of all human responses. But, rest assured, this will be the sixth time we have destroyed it, and we have become exceedingly efficient at it.  * Scene cuts to Trinity fighting an agent, and then back to the Architect's room. *   The Architect  - The function of the One is now to return to the source, allowing a temporary dissemination of the code you carry, reinserting the prime program. After which you will be required to select from the matrix 23 individuals: 16 female, 7 male, to rebuild Zion. Failure to comply with this process will result in a cataclysmic system crash killing everyone connected to the matrix, which coupled with the extermination of Zion will ultimately result in the extinction of the entire human race.   Neo  - You won't let it happen, you can't. You need human beings to survive.   The Architect  - There are levels of survival we are prepared to accept. However, the relevant issue is whether or not you are ready to accept the responsibility for the death of every human being in this world.  *The Architect presses a button on a pen that he is holding, and images of people from all over the matrix appear on the monitors*   The Architect  - It is interesting reading your reactions. Your five predecessors were by design based on a similar predication, a contingent affirmation that was meant to create a profound attachment to the rest of your species, facilitating the function of the one. While the others experienced this in a very general way, your experience is far more specific. Vis-a-vis, love.  *Images of Trinity fighting the agent from Neo's dream appear on the monitors*   Neo  - Trinity.   The Architect  - Apropos, she entered the matrix to save your life at the cost of her own.   Neo  - No!   The Architect  - Which brings us at last to the moment of truth, wherein the fundamental flaw is ultimately expressed, and the anomaly revealed as both beginning, and end. There are two doors. The door to your right leads to the source, and the salvation of Zion. The door to the left leads back to the matrix, to her, and to the end of your species. As you adequately put, the problem is choice.   But we already know what you're going to do, don't we? Already I can see the chain reaction, the chemical precursors that signal the onset of emotion, designed specifically to overwhelm logic, and reason. An emotion that is already blinding you from the simple, and obvious truth: she is going to die, and there is nothing that you can do to stop it.  *Neo walks to the door on his left*   The Architect  - Hmph. Hope. It is the quintessential human delusion, simultaneously the source of your greatest strength, and your greatest weakness.   Neo  - If I were you, I would hope that we don't meet again.   The Architect  - We won't.          "

3869393,female,Technology,"       Do you rely on a 'good gut reaction' or that 'special feeling' when interviewing perspective employees? Are you confident that your new hires will be successful? Are you good at interviewing prospective employees?  When I talk with executives and ask if they are good at selecting successful employees, they often indicate they have (or have not) been lucky lately. It’s not a matter of luck any more than picking a $50,000 piece of capital equipment is a matter of luck.  Recruiting is should be based on planning, excellent interviewing skills, and due diligence.  The Interview Today we are dealing with sophisticated applicants, many of whom are better interviewees than you may be an interviewer. They may have their resume professionally prepared or use sophisticated word processors with spell checkers and grammar checkers. Additionally, there are books, computer programs, tapes and classes to prepare a resume’ and to develop the ability to mask unpleasant information.  How many times do you finish an interview feeling that you just sat through a rehearsed script. If this is happening, you are probably not digging deep enough to get through the practiced veneer of the interviewee. An interview should be more than a conversation but less than an inquisition. An interview is a listening process to ferret out specific information to make a decision to hire or not hire.  If you are doing more than 40% of the talking you are not spending enough time listening. Furthermore, you should not be silently formulating the next question while the interviewee answers your previous question. When this happens, you’ve stopped listening.  In a naturally flowing interview, the candidate often telegraphs a weakness or an area to question. Follow your natural instincts when interacting with candidates. If something does not make sense, ask the candidate to clarify their statement and be sure to ask follow-up questions.  Another area be aware of is when a candidate says starts down a logic path and then reverses themselves or corrects a misstatement. When this happens; he or she is often making an effort to restate the practiced response. Go back to the original idea to determine which is the accurate answer.  If the candidate uses terms such as, 'we,' or 'they' or refers to a group or team, find out who was in the group, and what specifically was their role.  Be aware of body language. If their hands are clutched and they have white knuckles, if they suddenly lean back after you ask a question, if they are evasive, this may be a 'trouble' spot, so pursue the issue. There is probably is information in that area that you will want to know.  Questions As interviewers, we all have been advised to ask open ended questions such as 'tell me how you would manage the sales process.' Open-ended questions, which deal in hypothetical situations, are theory questions. It may be more beneficial to ask open-ended behavioral questions, especially if the individual is an experienced interviewee. For example, How did you ..., What happened when..., How did you get ...., When were (weren’t) you ...., With a practiced interviewee, it is important to move from the theoretical to the behavioral line of questions.  An experienced interviewer listens to the candidate’s answers and asked the follow-on questions, who, what, where, when, why. tell me more about ... , etc.  Checking References -- Due Diligence If you have come this far, conduct a thorough reference check. When checking references do not go to personnel or payroll. Try to talk to the individual’s supervisor. Ask for information about performance, interpersonal relations, ability, motivation, attendance as well as dates, titles and compensation. Listen carefully and if necessary push a little in order to get complete information. Often, you will learn something that will either solidify your decision or knock the candidate out of contention. Sometimes you will only be told the basics but even that information has value. Remember that when selecting an employee your organization’ reputation, sales goals, products, and financial well being are at stake. Proceed with caution. A human asset doesn’t come with a guarantee and may turn around and sue you.  Planning means that a position’s requirements and responsibilities should be well thought out, not a string of broad generalizations. Recently, while discussing a search assignment in financial services, I was told the requirements for the sales position was 'a person with a friendly personality, good quantitative skills and a solid work ethic.' I suggested that they needed to be more specific. Otherwise, with those requirements, half the applicants we see would probably qualify.  Before beginning the interview process, set up a grid of 'Musts' and 'Wants' like the one below. Write down the requirements, skills, responsibilities and standards for success. It you cannot complete this step you should not begin interviewing. Go back and rethink the position and its composition. Clear-up requirements, reporting relationships, responsibilities and standards for success. Uncertainty on critical points may cause you to lose good candidates and probably result in hiring the wrong candidate.  FACTORS MUSTS(Go -- No Go Decision) WANTS(Nice to Have) Knowledge     Experience     Personal Traits     Standards of Success     Hopefully the interviews will identify a candidate that can, and will do the job. If the process is positive end the interview with some sales presentation about the pluses of working for the company. Provide positive feedback to keep the candidate interested until a decision or offer can be made and references checked.     "

Here is why:  10: bin Laden was born in another country, but that's OK, Bush was born on another planet! 9: Bush needs bin Laden's money. All the multi-billionaires in the U.S. are pulling for Kerry. 8: bin Laden is even better at hiding than Cheney is. Only Bush knows the whereabouts of either one of them. 7: Like Bush, bin Laden does not believe in the separation of religion and government. 6: The Taliban is very good at punishing people with differing opinions. 5: Bush and bin Laden both deny their connections with Saddam Hussein. 4: With Kerry getting all the votes of singles, Catholics, women, and men under 30, Bush needs all the Muslim votes he can get. 3: bin Laden does not have any history of heart trouble, becuase he doesn't have a heart. 2: To get THIS economy out of recession, Bush not only needs God's help, he needs Allah's too.

883178,male,Fashion,"            I Love DJS  By Duf Fer  One of my main criticisms of American movies (hold on, I have to adjust my beret, it was about to slide off my big head) is that they feel the need to jam every moment with action. There has to be a kick, an explosion, a boob, a fantastic line, a  something  in every minute or the audience might become bored and go to the multi-million dollar action extravaganza instead.  Jackie Brown from one of our more explosive action directors, gives proof of Tarantinos versatility.  The opening moment, with Jackie on the moving walkway, I loved for three reasons (and we part company here, so there really isnt much point is going too much further):  1.  It sets up a very deliberate pace that Tarantino carries through the entire film (including the scene at the department store where pace is everything).  2.  It compels you to sympathize with this middle-aged black woman who works for a crap airline and makes a crap wage and has to hustle to make the rents.  In the same opening, when she starts to run so that she wont be late for work, I thought, man, when Im in my late 40s, I pray to God Im not a clock puncher who had to run to avoid being late for work.  3.  It pays homage (oh Tarantino and the homage) to all the Blaxploitation films that gave Pam Grier her fame.    4.  Okay, one more thing, the song in the background, Bobby Womacks Across 110th Street, thats the jam right there, son.  Thats the jam.  Also, the words are trying to tell you something.  I could go on and on about Jackie Brown, but I wont.  Suffice it to say that of his movies, it is by far the most  believable  to me.  I believe there are people like Jackie just trying to survive in Bushs America (oops, sorry for the slipmy beret got in my eyes while I was typing).  And Pam Grier, in my view, was absolutely dogged by the awards.  Her performance was off the hook (so was Robert Forsters).  I think that when the pace is a bit slower, it is easier to appreciate the acting, and this film is about controlled pace and controlled acting, both of which were handled extremely well by experts.     Like a brother,  Duf         "

It works!  I left that little girl in her blue and beige uniform, with tweety bird lunchbox slung across her shoulder, hand in hand with her teacher.  Bye, baby... kiss kiss.

3305309,male,indUnk,"            When it opened in April 1994, the San Antonio baseball park now known as Nelson Wolff Stadium was called “the Jewel of the Texas League,” and Mickey Holt, Public Relations Director for the San Antonio Missions, still likes to call it that.  It’s a definite upgrade from the former home of the Missions, V. J. Keefe Memorial Stadium – an old, primarily wooden structure still in use by the St. Mary’s University Rattlers, which looks, sadly, on first impression, like sufficiently combustible kindling for a one-match fire. When compared to the newest parks in the league, including Round Rock’s immaculate Dell Diamond and the currently-under-construction Whataburger Field in Corpus Christi, Nelson Wolff Stadium looks as if it’s from another epoch, and in the development of the American sports stadium, coming just before Camden Yards in Baltimore revolutionized our present-day conceptions of what a baseball stadium should be, it pretty much is.   Holt calls it a pitcher’s park, noting that there’s an almost-constant 15 mph wind blowing in from right-center field. They’re not looking to replace it anytime soon, as it is still clean and serviceable and relatively new, but Holt notes that they’d really like to get a scoreboard with a video screen, when thinking about upgrades that are realistic and might inch them closer to Dell Diamond status, to replace the Alamo-shaped one in right field. Holt also think they should be drawing more than the 4400 a game they average, not only because San Antonio is the eighth largest city in the nation and boasts a healthy number of sports fans, but because the Missions are downright good, having won Texas League championships in 2002 and 2003. Certainly, it doesn’t escape you, if you attend a game in the 2004 season, that they’re back-to-back champions – the phrase is the core of their marketing campaign, appearing on the scoreboard, and on shirts, and on the jersey of their official mascot, an anthropomorphic jalapeno pepper with googly eyes named Ballapeno.   Riding out in the middle of the first inning on a motorized scooter, the Ballapeno indulges in the sort of fun, wacky mascot antics you’d expect of a mascot playing to 4400 a night who’ve come to watch Double A players with big league aspirations. He rides in the back of a truck around the perimeter of the field and shoots rolled-up T-shirts into the crowd as the truck loops its way past the infield seats. He dances on top of the dugout. He wanders into the crowd, pulls caps off children’s heads playfully, and slaps hands with adults who cannot resist the pull of a giant jalapeno pepper with googly eyes.   But at the end of the sixth inning, another, more mysterious mascot heads to second base, to the instant recognition and obvious delight of the crowd. This is the unofficial mascot, who has been with the team since a local restaurant sponsored him to come out to V. J. Keefe back in 1988 for a series of promotional appearances. Two years ago, Newsweek named him the minor league mascot of the year, even though Ballapeno has been the official Missions mascot since Opening Day of the 2000 Season, and one look at him is all it really takes to understand why.  Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you:  Henry the Puffy Taco.   The Puffy Taco very nearly defies conventional mascot wisdom. Typically, mascots are cartoonish depictions of people or animals or even objects, yet they wear distinctive human features like eyes and a mouth. It’s for the same reasons that babies and baby animals come into the world cute – to start the process of attachment, to allow the parents to want to care for it. Even the Corpus Christi Hooks, who will begin Texas League play in 2005, have started their marketing campaign by floating out a logo which appears to be a giant fishing hook with eyes and a mouth, and it wouldn’t at all be surprising if this gets committed to fabric and is set in motion to wander the stands next spring.   But the Puffy Taco doesn’t even try for recognizable facial features. It is, simply, gloriously, without pretense, a taco. More precisely, the costume is an open shell facing forward and standing on its end, covering the head and torso, with holes for the arms and legs to protrude from the shell. Because there’s no better way to describe this, vulva-like folds of lettuce and cheese protrude slightly from behind the open folds of the shell, all but enveloping the dark-red cylinder at the center of the taco, which is clearly where the actor’s head and torso fit, and which has to be meant to represent the meat at the center of the taco, although this would make the costume more of a hot-dog taco than a ground beef taco. “Henry the Puffy Taco” is stitched along the back of the taco shell at its bottom edge, for the four or five people in the audience on any given night who need clarification on who this is.  The Puffy Taco’s act is simple yet effective, and is a thirty-second case study in everything that is glorious yet low-rent about minor league baseball – that, indeed, is glorious precisely because it is so low-rent. The Puffy Taco starts at second base, and runs for home plate by way of third. A child is selected from the audience; it is his or her job to tackle the Puffy Taco before he reaches home. There’s a Roadrunner and Wile E. Coyote certainty to the act; it always concludes with the child tackling the Taco, and the show has evolved to incorporate an additional moment of triumph in which the child is allowed to clamber on top of the Taco and lift his or her hands skyward to make the “raise the roof” gesture. I think you can probably figure out what the crowd does in response.  Then, the Taco gets up and does a dance, and circulates through the stands for another half-inning or so, slapping hands and greeting the kids who flock around him, before giving the stage over to the Ballapeno for the rest of the evening.   The Taco’s act has evolved on its own over time. Initially, there was no tackling – as Holt explains, the first tackle was actually an overzealous kid bumping into the Taco during a race. What was ordained from the beginning was that the kid was always supposed to win. Holt recalls that on the one occasion the Taco won the race, when the Taco’s act was still in its early stages of development, the crowd reacted with enough booing and general displeasure to assure that that wouldn’t ever be happening again. . Over time, the two concepts – kid always triumphs, kid triumphs by tackling the Taco before he reaches home plate – merged into what is now the standard nightly ritual.   As mascot theater goes, the Taco’s act is simple and slapstick and interactive and allows a child to emerge triumphant in a situation that is not quite man v. beast but is similar enough to evoke feelings of top-of-the-food-chain superiority and the resultant joy that comes with that. For San Antonians, there’s an additional level to why the victory over the Puffy Taco works as a gimmick, and that has a lot to do with the fact that people in San Antonio really like their food.   The current mayor of San Antonio, Ed Garza, who is still in his early thirties yet was reelected to a second term in 2003, has been moved by a series of Men’s Fitness polls perennially listing San Antonio as one of the fattest cities in the nation to push something called the Fit City Initiative. But there’s a larger, easier, more informal movement that Fit City is pushing against, which will probably emerge triumphant at the end of the day, and that’s the citywide drive to eat a lot of fattening food, often in public.  Every April, the city essentially shuts down for a 10-day conglomeration of festivals and parades called Fiesta. At the heart of the 100-plus Fiesta events are two major parades which draw as many as half a million spectators and are serviced by a staggering number of makeshift festival food stands. The Night in Old San Antonio event, which runs four days in the city’s La Villita and is another major Fiesta draw, allows its thousands upon thousands of annual attendees a chance to eat and drink with abandon. There’s music and dancing and street festival frivolity to be had here, but ask any attendee, and they’re more likely than not to tell you they are there for the variegated meats on a stick or the gorditas or the fresh handmade tortillas or the bratwurst or crepes or frog legs or potato skins or any number of other foods.  The night before the first Krispy Kreme franchise opened in San Antonio, a line began forming outside its doors; by morning, 500 people had gathered, having camped out all night for access to the first hot, sticky, rings of fried dough to roll off the assembly lines and into their waiting mouths.  And every year in late January, right before the annual San Antonio Stock Show and Rodeo, a loose coalition of organizers host a Friday morning Cowboy Breakfast. Even though it has moved from location to location in the last few years, the annual Cowboy Breakfast always draws in the neighborhood of 40 to 50 thousand, no matter what the conditions outside, to gather in the early morning hours for food that is, in a particularly important calling card to the people of San Antonio, free. The San Antonio Express-News article on the 2004 Cowboy Breakfast, with reporter Lisa Marie Gomez following in the well-worn path of previous reporters’ stories on the event, begins this way:    The drizzle, patchy fog and 49-degree weather at 5 a.m. Friday were quickly forgotten when the bands blared their tunes and hot coffee and food were served. The Cowboy Breakfast was in full swing at Crossroads of San Antonio mall two hours before the sun made its debut for the day, and traffic piled up as if it were the evening rush hour. Despite the morning darkness and the cool weather, families came out in droves. One family piled into a van, with children, cousins, and even grandparents. “We’re here for the free food,” Wicho Guerra said as he munched on a slice of white bread drowned in gravy. “I have no idea what I’m eating, but it’s good.”   So it is clear that the Fit City Initiative has a way to go. Tourism, after all, is one of the city’s largest industries, and food is at the backbone of San Antonio’s allure for locals and visitors alike.   The Puffy Taco mascot gets its name from a Tex-Mex innovation that has been adopted by a number of the city’s vast array of Mexican restaurants. Specifically, it was Jamie Lopez, the son of the Henry’s Puffy Tacos owner, who came up with the idea for the Puffy Taco mascot in 1988 as a way to further associate the puffy taco dish with his dad’s restaurant. Henry’s Puffy Tacos, a Westside restaurant which opened in 1978 and relocated to a former Luby’s cafeteria around the corner in 1996, naturally lays claim to its title dish despite having many other offerings on the menu.   The puffy taco is a crispy taco with a shell that puffs up in the deep-frying process, filled to bursting with meat, lettuce, tomatoes, and cheese. A Citysearch review of Henry’s noted, “The shell of Henry’s signature dish is what newly fallen snow would feel like in your mouth – if it was fried.”   If you’re wise, and if you’re throwing caloric caution to the wind as you should be when you order the puffy taco, you’ll want to top it with sour cream and guacamole and salsa. Eating it is a messy affair, and is not so much a meal as it is a mainlining of fatty, spicy goodness. It’s a safe bet that Wicho Guerra and his clan have sprung for a dinner here at some point in their gastronomical journeys. And though they may not know exactly what they’re eating when they plunge into their puffy tacos, it’s safe to say they will determine it is, indeed, good.  But because Henry’s is far from the well-trafficked tourist haunts of the city, on a major arterial that cuts through a working-class, predominantly Mexican-American neighborhood, the Puffy Taco is a bit of a mystery to those tourists who find themselves taking in a Missions game at Nelson Wolff. A writer for minorleagueballparks.com, writing a review of the stadium in 1999, wrote, “I didn’t like the fact that the ‘Puffy Taco’ mascot was actually an advertisement for a fast-food chain,” and a scribe for ballparkreviews.com expressed disappointment that the Puffy Taco only makes his one appearance, despite “hearing much hype” about him.  Wesley Ratliff understands the tradition, though. At just 24 years old, Ratliff is the community outreach director for the Missions, which is an official way of saying that he is a professional mascot. He pulls double duty during each Missions home game, portraying both the Puffy Taco and Ballapeno, which is why they rarely appear in the same place at the same time.   Ratliff personifies the duality of San Antonio’s version of Generation Y perfectly – he sports a goatee and a tongue piercing that suggests a straight-from-MTV mainstream edginess, yet he’s unfailingly polite, responding to a number of questions from my interview with him with a demure and polite, “Yes, sir.”   Ratliff already has a long, impressive resume as a mascot. He started out as Eloc, the cougar mascot for Cole Junior/Senior High School, located on the Fort Sam Houston U.S. Army base, and best known as the alma mater of Shaquille O’Neal. Ratliff then moved on to serve as a mascot for the University of the Incarnate Word, one of San Antonio’s four-year Catholic universities, wearing one of the nation’s first inflatable costumes. He later moved on to professional mascothood at two of San Antonio’s prime theme parks, Sea World and Six Flags Fiesta Texas, and realized a lifelong dream of performing at Walt Disney World, taking a whirlwind tour in which he was allowed to portray Tigger, Eeyore, Gepetto, Tweedledee, Tweedledum, and Miss Piggy over the course of several weeks.  His new lifelong dream, fed by his two full-time years and six part-time years with the Missions, is to make it into the big league mascot ranks; last year, he was in the running to take over as Raymond, the mascot for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, which he describes somewhat perplexedly as “a sort of hairy troll thing.” He was one of two final candidates, and was ultimately the odd man out, but it’s clear that missing out on the chance to depict a hairy troll for one of MLB’s most moribund franchises might be a blessing in disguise. Ratliff graciously opines that it was an honor just to be in the running.  He’s also suffered for his art, having two surgeries on his knee for a torn meniscus – the first was the result of being tackled while portraying the Taco, the second came after a car accident aggravated the fragile ligament. The first actor playing the Puffy Taco also suffered a similar knee injury, leading one to believe that what a fifty-pound-child lacks in mass and force in tackling the Taco, he or she more than makes up for it in questionable technique, and is perhaps the prime Occupational Hazard for those with the calling to be a mascot.  Ratliff, despite the trick knee, is fortunate in that he is able to carve out a living as a professional mascot – a number of his colleagues on the Texas League circuit are actually salespeople within their respective organizations, moonlighting as the mascot in the sort of double-duty that isn’t at all surprising given the limited budgets on many minor-league teams.  And unlike a number of the other minor-league mascots toiling away in obscurity, Ratliff has at least enjoyed a fleeting yet memorable taste of the bigs. Last year, for fan appreciation day for the Mission’s parent organization, the Seattle Mariners, Ratliff was invited to Safeco Field where he performed as both the Ballapeno and Puffy Taco alongside the Moose, the Mariners’ lovable yet improbable mascot, the one enduring remnant from the team’s former owner Jeff Smulyan of Indianapolis-based Emmis Communications – a chapter of Seattle baseball history that many Mariners fans would just as soon forget.   Ratliff recalls his reception as nothing short of rock star. As the Taco, he accompanied the Moose for a G-rated version of running the gauntlet – being doused with water by Mariners players in a ritualized procession across the field. He reports that the crowd responded instantly when he came out, and later, he signed autographs for a crowd of fans waiting as long as 45 minutes in line to meet him.  He also learned, on this trip, that he has it pretty good in the minor leagues. Mascots in the majors are bound by a longer list of rules than he’s bound by. The Colorado Rockies mascot, also on hand at Safeco for Fan Appreciation Day is bound to stricter rules than the Moose – or, for that matter, Ratliff himself. The Rockies’ mascot can’t be on the field after the ceremonial first pitch, and can’t be on the dugout ever. Ratliff, by contrast, pretty much has license to go whenever he wants wherever he wants, allowed to read the crowd and create his moments as he pleases.  For all the love the Puffy Taco and Ballapeno receive, San Antonio’s heart belongs to another mascot, basically because its heart belongs to another team.   Despite the century-plus history of minor league baseball in San Antonio,  and despite having one of the most rabid high school football fan bases in football-obsessed Texas, San Antonio is a basketball town, and every other sport is thus relegated to being not-basketball. The Spurs have only been around since 1973, but because the team is the city’s highest-profile professional sports franchise, it enjoys a unique and revered position among San Antonians, and this extends to mascots, as none is more recognizable or more beloved than the Coyote.  Tim Derk, who debuted The Coyote in 1983, suffered a stroke this past March and has had to turn the job of playing the Coyote to understudies while he undergoes rehabilitation -- ending a 21-year run of donning a coyote mask with bulging bright green eyes and an easy-going, yet slightly maniacal, permanent grin.   The stroke not only sidelined Derk – it led him, his family, and the Spurs organization to do the unprecedented thing and reveal The Coyote’s identity to the public. For many, it was the first time they’d learned who Tim Derk was, and was also the first time they’d learned to separate Derk as someone distinct from The Coyote.   Derk’s condition was major news in San Antonio, dominating headlines and local newscasts for several days. The reaction showed that San Antonio, for all its aspirations to be a big city, is still a small town, in the good sense, at its core. Though we generally like our mascots anonymous in day-to-day life, and transformed into the lovable character when safely encased in the costume, there was no question of Derk’s family and the Spurs organization going public with the information. There was an overwhelming need to know, evinced by the media barrage and the remarkable groundswell of public support once Derk’s condition was made public, which easily overrode the typical willingness of a fan base to buy into the suspension of disbelief manifest in engaging with a mascot.  The Coyote has remained a fixture at Spurs games even while Derk continues rehab, and now, Derk’s legacy and years of service adds an additional layer of legend to The Coyote. It wouldn’t at all be surprising if his number (the cryptic “2!” – standing for “too excited”) is retired should Derk decide not to resume his role as The Coyote – though he’s not ruling out a return to the court, depending on how his physical therapy sessions go.  What the situation with The Coyote reveals, aside from the connection that fans have with a mascot, is the importance of the mascot in articulating the team’s identity, even beyond the role it might have had in years past. If you’re looking to point fingers as why it’s harder for teams to bank on the marketability of its star players, look no further than the era of free agency.  As a fan in his mid-30s, I might just be part of the last generation to know what it’s like to see a favorite player remain with a favorite team for the entirety of his career.  As a Mariners fan, I have seen Ken Griffey, Jr. go from Seattle fan favorite to trade-me malcontent, and now, I’m more likely to remember his statistical disappearing act as an oft-injured Cincinnati Red than as part of the Mariners’ feel-good father-son duo that once hit back-to-back home runs in a game on (and this is so terribly fitting) Father’s Day.  As a Mariners fan, I have seen Randy Johnson develop from wild-man anomaly to one of the most feared left-handed power pitchers in the history of the game – and then saw him help deliver a World Series to the Arizona Diamondbacks, a team that entered the majors as an expansion team long after the Mariners. (Note: it is not lost on me that the Mariners are closing in on three full decades of futility.) As I write this in July 2004, the Diamondbacks are contemplating trading him, and Johnson is hinting, not so subtly, that he’d like to become a Yankee. This is particularly cruel for Mariners fans who remember his role in defeating the Yankees in a five-game divisional series in the ’95 playoffs, a series which was not only deliciously epic, but pretty much allowed Mariners fans to hate the Yankees with a blend of loathing and jealousy only surpassed by Red Sox fans.   And I have seen the worst free-agency jump of all, for Mariners fans or otherwise, in Alex Rodriguez. A-Rod was drafted by the Mariners, came up quickly through the team’s farm system, was a wide-eyed September call-up in uniform for the ’95 playoffs, became the team’s most crucial player during its high-water mark as an organization, and then left for a $252 million contract (from a division rival, no less) that could be characterized by any reasonable observer as either obscene or insane. After several years of insisting money was not the motivating factor, even though he toiled for the Texas Rangers through several moribund seasons, he was jettisoned to the only team that could take his monstrous contract – the hated Yankees.   For minor league fans, inconstancy in the roster is a heartbreak that comes with the territory. It’s no accident that the minor leagues are referred to as the farm system – players are nurtured and then harvested, the wheat is separated from the chaff, and the cycle repeats itself annually.  But for major league fans, the free agent market has brought on an inconstancy that they assumed (correctly, up until now) they were immune from. Which makes the mascot more than just a sideshow to fill time and amuse the kids between innings – the mascot has become, more than any individual player, the face of the franchise, the one personality guaranteed to return year after year. The most dedicated baseball fans, addicted to statistics and the hope that comes with spring training, have turned to rotisserie leagues to insure that they can be in control of players maintaining their allegiance to teams – even if those teams are mere constructs in infinite variations among thousands upon thousands of makeshift leagues around the nation.  But, paradoxically, in the real world, the most enduring representative of what the team embodies is not a five-tool outfielder with a distinctive batting stance, or a pitcher with enough guile and raw talent to change the outcome of a game with his multi-million dollar arm, but a moose with a comically-large head, or an electric-blue marlin, or a non-descript green monster with a nose that vaguely resembles a trumpet. The pitcher and the outfielder might be dealt for prospects in the closing days of July, or might bolt to a contender at the first opportunity that MLB’s free agency rules afford them. The mascots, though, save for a conscious redirection of the team’s marketing people, are there to stay.   San Antonio is a city where people tend to settle in and grow old, and indeed, where multiple generations spend entire lifetimes. It’s a city where traditions are taken very seriously, where the two biggest institutional influences are the military and the Catholic Church. What this means, even with the rise of the Ballapeno, even with the rare convergence of animated jalapeno and animated taco in the same space, is that the Puffy Taco isn’t going anywhere. It’s perhaps no accident that Mickey Holt notes, “If we ever got rid of the Puffy Taco, we’d be crucified.  Yet, in talking to Wesley Ratliff, you get the sense that he will inevitably move on. He’s just entered his mid-20s and has already been a mascot for almost a decade. He’s come agonizingly close to toiling for Tampa Bay fans this year as a non-descript troll. He’s already had a glimpse of life as a big-league mascot, and he likes it. If anyone is cut out for the mascot’s life, Wesley is that person.  When he goes away, the mascot costumes will still remain – a jalapeno with googly eyes, and a taco with no eyes – waiting to be worn by someone who remain, if all goes to plan, anonymous. Though a different person will embody the role, the bio info on the team’s official website will remain the same, in the jokey tone and cadence that is common to mascot bios at all levels of the game.   And it’s a safe bet that years from now, between the 6th and 7th inning of future Missions games, the Puffy Taco will take his place at second base, and a child currently not yet born will take his or her place alongside the Taco. They will run around the bases. The Taco will not make it to home plate, being tackled along the way. It will be someone else’s knees taking the torque, enduring another child’s zeal manifest in a tackle. And as the Taco lies on the ground, to the cheers of the crowd for another in a chain of consecutive nights, the Taco will know his place is secure. In a city where traditions rule all, and in which the Taco has become a quirky and enduring tradition, no one will let the Taco escape this mortal coil. Even today, if you listen closely between the 6th and 7th inning as the Taco makes his entrance, underneath the cheers, you can hear a handful of people quickly explaining to those who don’t yet know – the children, the visitors, the neophytes – the answer to the inevitable question, the variations on the theme of What the Hell Is That.

Jackie Chan's 'Shanghai Knights' opened the day before yesterday in Japan.  But because he was hard at work on 'New Police Story, Jackie was unable to promote the movie in person.  But he still attracted a large number of Japanese media who arrived in Hong Kong to interview him.  He accepted interviews from 'Sports Daily' and 'Sankei Sports' and disclosed his planned construction of the Jackie village in Hong Kong.  Each part of the facility [would be world class.]  Jackie Chan said, '...I plan a Jackie village!  Besides having a movie themed park, we could have a theater, a [sports area?] and a Jackie museum.  Jackie had originally had this idea on his mind for several years.  He said, 'Although Jackie Village is still in the planning stage, there has already been four or five meetings with the Hong Kong government.  The final plan isn't in cement yet, and I can't disclose details.  It was a secret!  There are still a lot of plans for the project.  Moreover, from the beginning until now it's been about two or three years.  I believe in order to complete the project it would take ten years!'  A few years ago there were rumors of plans to construct a Jackie Chan museum in Yokohama, but the plan was stopped.  Now Jackie has regained hope.  http://www.the-sun.com.hk/channels/ent/20031117/img/c21117_big.jpg         "

I am not dead.  I have been traveling too much, and I have not been down with the blog ups like I should be (gotta get down to get up - BB, can that be a song recommendation for you - put on some James Brown, honey - you can get bogged down in the sad stuff...put on something funky or something angry and draw your poisons to the surface then drink lots of water - all massage therapists advise it.  Which reminds me, spoil yourself too.  Get a facial and a massage and play a round golf at The Wilds in Shakopee).  Anyway, not much is on with me.  Hal and I are in Dallas for a meeting.  Yesterday I was in Tampa...tomorrow I will be in Columbus, Ohio.  It is too much.  I am finally starting to see that...it is too much.  Here is a story.  Last night, Hal and I went to Dealey Plaza to decipher this grassy knoll stuff.  Maybe all that is needed to unravel the Kennedy conspiracy are a fresh set of eyes and some Minnesota pragmatism.  Anyway, it was late-ish, around 9:30, and it was dark.  We were kind of walking around not really getting all the right stuff when this kind fellow (he called himself Miquel Bolton - and I did not get it until I got back to the hotel) came up and explained that we were pointing at the wrong grassy knoll (the place is thick with knolls and they are all grassy).    Well, we are in Texas, and the people are very friendly here (I know this because the 10 people I asked for directions (to the restaurant (Taco Diner in West Village, I recommend it for your next trip the Big D, but warning, no one knows where it is - ask for the West Village mall instead and directions to Dealey Plaza, and directions to our Hilton in Grapevine) were all way nice and...if they didn't know how to direct me, overly disappointed), and Miquel was no exception.  He showed us the window where Oswald ALLEGEDLY fired the shot (Miquel does not buy the lone gunman theory at all nor does he buy the magic bullet theory), he showed us the X that is embedded in Elm street to mark the spot where Kennedy was hit for the first time.  He showed us the manhole cover where the second shot threw his head back, and he showed us where the guy stood who fired shots from behind the what?  That's right,  the  grassy knoll.  He showed us the terrace they have erected in back of the grassy knoll, the memorial, the conspiracy museum.  He explained how the manhole shooter escaped, and how the knoll shooter fled.  He pointed out where Oswald was apprehended, where he was booked in, how he was transferred from one jail to another and the hallway where he was shot by Jack Ruby.  He showed us the austere memorial whose erection (I wrote erection...tee hee) was requested by Jackie O (I used erection and Jackie O in the same sentence...tee hee), and he read the plaque explaining how the citizens of Dallas paid for it (with contributions from others).  He even told us where he was (Waco, Texas) and what he was doing ('getting his play on'  yes, that's a quote - he was 4 at the time) when he heard about the assassination.  His grandfather cried and he recalled that as unusual.  He had never seen that before.  For those of you who have read this post believing that people are genuinely kind and that they offer help and tour guidance from an altruistic spirit of love for fellow man and to add another stone to the solid strong structure we call the community of [wo]man, you are right, just don't read the next paragraph.  Miquel walked us back to our car and explained that he was out of work and needed money to send his daughter to Six Flags tomorrow.  He was working us the whole time.  It gets worse.  Duf, as usual, was cashless.  Hal went into the car and into her purse to cough up a five-spot, and Miquel said (quoting again), 'Miss Hal, can you dig a little deeper?'  BTW, I'm in favor of disclosing all fees up front.  Anyway, as we drove away, Hal, who has always been a bit too PC for my tastes.  Argued that men like Miquel, are a tragedy.  He was bright and personable and knowledgeable about the area.  He was articulate and his sales skills were keen.  He may have had a drinking problem.  I genuinely enjoyed the tour, even as I knew (fairly early on) there was a hook.  But Miquel is not employable, Hal pointed out - a blatant argument for helping the less fortunate - a view I spit on as a hardcore capitalist.  Why should I work to support people who can't just get a stinkin' job?  Explain that Miss PC Hal!           "

2948997,female,Student,"       So Today I was going to work for Vic at his accounting business, but because I'm a new kid...I'm not needed yet. I could be skiing tonight, but maybe I'll just lay in bed and pretend I'm a mole. I'll just cuddle deep into the blankets in a dark embrace consumed with the smell of warmth. True to a mole, I am blind when it comes to the world. I think when I just think I've figured something out, I'm tossed a hardball and I never quite comphrehend it once again. I feel like I'm so young looking at everything and I can't fully see the big picture.   What triggers this is my jealousy towards situations and people. Jealousy is not always a bad thing, actually it encourages friendly competation at times... but at others...it has a nasty streak of green which likes to flair up at certain times. Sometimes I feel jealous towards people because of what they have, or who they have. It's a natural reaction to something you want for the sake of wanting it.   I'm not sure...why I have these feelings sometimes. But! who really understands the female mind...or even the teenage brain. Sometimes I'm jealous of Martin and Kate, Jane and Paul because of the love they all seem to have for each other and everyone involved. I sit back sometimes and wish I could have someone in love with me as much as Martin is with Katie. I have alot of respect for these four people as I can honestly say from the bottom of my heart that I love them. I love them every much and maybe its because I see them in a non-judgemental way and in a positive manner that I compare myself to them. Thats one of the main problems of myself. I compare myself to others. I put myself up against others who have different strengths...and weaknesses.   For the longest time I compared myself to Dana, who was someone in my eyes who I just wanted to emulate. I wanted to be as smart and as talented as him. Did I ever stop to realize that I slowly was transforming myself and become less of me and more like him. I found some things along the way that I actually did enjoy. I really enjoy barenaked ladies, politics, acroynms, and assorted other stuff.   And time management...I joined Team Youth because I felt I should. I felt pressured into it and I'm losing interest very quickly. We never do anything...and well. At times I feel this is a pointless organization because what the fuck do we seem to be doing? I know I made a committment to the organization at the beginning of the year, but sometimes I just don't want to go and do anything. I want to lay at home and sleep and just be alone. I don't want to be around anyone. This means that I have to send fucking Kelly an email explaining my schedule. How do you explain that you just don't want to be part of anything because you want to be depressed and boring and lick all your wounds that lately have had salt pressed deep into them. How do you explain that you would rather sit home alone on a friday evening typing in your blog than interacting with people because you know if you interact with people there is tension, or theres a chance there could be a problem.  So I'm going to work tonight for Vic actually. Have to be there for 5pm. I'm washing my clothing...geezus. If I would have known then I wouldn't have washed it. I have to schedule some damn appointments tonight!   I just want to cry. I want to find something and hold tight. I'm rebounding.   In short, FUCK FUCK FUCK and FUCK!    "

The buildings, the people, even the attitude of the whole place are the same. I love the fact that year after year I can depend on it to be it’s old comforting place. I feel like I’m in a dream. I know every face I see, even the parents, but I fear they don’t remember me. I fear I’m just a confusingly familiar face. I’ve changed so much from last time they’ve seen me up till now. I wonder if they can see that. I am curious to find out if how I am now will effect the way I function in this place differently than before.

1708471,female,indUnk,"           IB is a bunch of crap and a waste of time. I'm not even going for the diploma and I'm saying this, but it's true. I'm trying to get the IB certificate in IB Bio. so hopefully I'll do good on the test, but anyways ya we had our group 4 projects due today. I worked on it basically non-stop except when I was gone for an hour at a lacrosse meeting, until 1:30!!! It's insane and so like whoa! Anyways I actually put a lot of work into my poster and everything else and after today and the 'presentations' I've never felt so much like I wasted my time! Seriously I got soooooooo stressed out because of it and because of all this figuring shit out with my partner, which ended up giving me no partner at all, and then today it felt like a joke. Also, Ms. Divinski didn't tell us any specifics on what she wanted so I did extra by making a lab report, and ya she didn't tell us that we only needed the poster until today. Feeling like I wasted my time and go so freaked out about something and have it barely matter in the end, really really pisses me off. I don't waste my time, especially when it comes to homework. Oh and for those who don't get the title, my project delt with comparing the growth of bacteria on cheese and yogurt.   Lacrosse has started, well at least captains, that makes me really happy. I was only able to go to 2 practices this week though and I was late to both of them..... funny though 'cause I didn't go all because of group 4!! Oh how I love it..... not! Anyways this is my favorite time of year, sure I may be a little more stressed out 'cause of all the AP tests and IB tests and because I'm realizing how badly I need to get my grades up, but then when I'm at lacrosse everything just kind of goes away, well for the most part it does, I just can't get pissed off about anything. But ya lacrosse is my favorite sport ever and I love playing and I loving wanting to excel and get better, in all the other sports I play I don't care too much if I get better, but this sport I do, I want to work to my fullest potential...... I just need to make sure I get enough sleep so I don't pass out and die when I play. Not only that but spring starts and it gets warm and oh man how I love the warm weather, I love the smell and I love the feeling, and I love the sun, it doesn't get any better.   It's funny 'cause Lauren and I were talking about how when you get a boyfriend or girlfriend, which ever way you flow, haha whenever you write in your blogs they're usually a lot more giddy and happier, which I think for the  most part is true. It's either that or you don't have anything to write about because you have nothing to complain about or becuase you just don't care about anything else. Sorry if I've gotten boring in my blogs, I'm trying to do good and enterain all 2 of you, I really am.   Note: Qudaba is much better than Chipotle..... thanks for introducing that to me Alison! Next time though..... I don't think I should be the one driving.... haha, it's just a good thing Aly is alive.   Oh man I'll be so happy in 2 weeks, spring break, that's all I am thinking about to make me last until then, only 2 more weeks. Man I've got John Mayer and I might be going to New York City, where I've never been, for a couple of days, so excited.  Man I am so tierd and have so much hatred for school, but besides that I love so many things right now, I love it. : ) Now as long as I stick to that and don't think about school....... oh wait school is on my mind probably  55% of the time, Aaron and the lacrosse is the other 45%. Hmmm is this good or bad? Probably bad, this is what school has done to me, wow.   Anyone have any ideas where to take some good photos?  Ok, kisses to all! Kati          "

Ok enough for the creepy comments for today.&nbsp; I also met this girl named Lauren, pronounced Like Ralph Lauren.&nbsp; She was pretty cool. We all sat around on the front picture talking about random things.&nbsp; I told them about when my father died, and Rosie started crying, and I felt really bad.&nbsp; Apparently, according to her and Sasja, I'm like a cat in that I can sense when people really need someone, and 'if I'm in a good mood'&nbsp; (those were her exact words! lol) I'll help them. I also got to see Emilia, and Spencer again.&nbsp; I saw them a couple weeks ago, but only for a little while at that concert downtown.&nbsp; Pretty much everybody else I'd seen pretty recently.&nbsp; I missed Brianna though, and I was sad. So now everyone has left for a store in search of food, cause Laura has nothing.&nbsp; I'm down here checking my e-mail, and updating my blog.&nbsp; Kourtenay sent me this big email that was like a survey about her... It had all these questions on it like, 'Am I fat?'&nbsp; and I just got really uncomfortable.&nbsp; I really don't wanna fill it out right now, cause I'm really tired, but I'll probably do it later, even though I don't want to.&nbsp; Some of the questions will be really hard to answer, but I think she deserves the truth.&nbsp; I dunno, maybe I'll talk it over with Laura first.&nbsp; That would be the really smart thing to do.&nbsp; Anyway, I'm dirty and repulsive, so I'm going in seek of a shower now, k?&nbsp; see ya later.

589736,male,Technology,"           Hey John!  It's weird to hear that you didn't think that people in the UK care about US politics.  The article that Ben put up was from the  Independent  and it is one of the most reputable and widespread newpapers here.  That story was on the front page.  People in Europe generally know more about US politics than Americans do, since our decisions seem to greatly affect them.  People here are terrified that George Bush is going to get elected again and when they hear things like that story, they get even more nervous.  They blame Bush for dragging them into a war that they don't want to be in.  The protest against the invasion of Iraq in London last February was the largest public demonstration that has ever occured in England.  Tony Blair completely ignored the consensus of the people, which led to his lovely nickname, 'Bush's Bitch'.  Due to Blair's alliance with the US concerning the occupation of Iraq, the Labour party might lose its power in the up-coming elections.  The Liberal Democrats have already gained alot of seats in Parliment and polls show that they will most likely gain many more.  America is a super power and right now Bush's shitty foreign diplomacy skills have angered people all over the world and caused them to rally against us.  Now the papers are saying that the US is giving Iran a deadline to prove that it doesn't have nuclear weapons.  Sound familiar?  That worked so well last time.  How that hell can you prove that you don't have something?  Any way, the majority of people here are intensely hoping that Bush will get voted out soon.  English media is typically very well researched.  The newspapers here were the first to release reports on the how Bush stole the Florida election.  Okay...just realized that I'm rambling, so I'm going to stop myself there.    On to fun things.  Nick, my boy here, is coming to the US for Christmas!  Yay.  Isn't that exciting?  He might be performing at that new comedy club in Richmond, but his agent is still working that out.  Miriam, hope you realize that you're hanging out with me when I get home, cause you have to meet him.  Okay.  That's all.         "

4262796,male,indUnk,"       I would normally put this in the comments section, but my esteemed colleague forgot to utilize that tool.  From my brief study of Sigmund Freud, I have formulated a belief that the real object of the punk anger is their small genitalia.  Besides the obvious implications that go with that territoty there is also a reduced testosterone level which prevents said punks from being successful at manly endeavors such as sports.  This coupled with their subpar intelligence leaves them little option but 'reject' the society that in fact rejected them first.         "

3359005,male,Student,"             Wow! Ok... So today I got caught in ths thing that was shockingly similar to the 'Don't talk to me!' from Lance last episode of the Amazing Race. As you all know, the one person I really can't stand in class is Kelvin Chen. With his whiny voice and incessant speaking when spoken, or even not spoken to, I have about this much tolerance left for him.  Well, I don't know if he's under the impression that we're actually on good terms, cause he actually dared ask me for help. During recess, I was casually walking to my seat when he cut right in front of me and went 'Have you seen Liwei?' Really like Lance, cause I don't think he was expecting the person he hated most to talk to him. I honestly thought that 'Don't talk to me!' was going to come out of my mouth, but instead, I just stood there for a moment and then shrugged. Ahah... That just proves that the 'Don't talk to me!' was uncalled for! Boo to Marshall & Lance, who are rumoured to go next week. Thank everything on and off the earth should that happen!  Anyway why he asked for Liwei was because the estate office found out about the key. What happened was that the smartest boy in the class, Liwei, was handed the key on Friday to open the door back from the lab. He did the stupidest thing by throwing the key around and it eventually landed in the gap behing the whiteboard. Now it can't come out. Oh the irony that the smartest boy in class would do the most stupid thing! Anyway for a moment he thought he was doomed but 'Oh my Saviour!' Kelvin turned out a duplicate key. Supposedly he was afraid something like that would happen and took the key for duplication, complete with yellow tag and class printed. He managed to dodge the estate for the weekend but yesterday someone returned late and the estate man took a look at the key knew it was a duplicate.  Ahh... Control freak Kelvin gets into trouble for trying to handle too many things at once. Another person's in charge of the key, but he, with his OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) about trying to be all responsible and running the class, has taken over since the start of the year. How much you want to bet he'll push the blame?  Oh yeah, more on class happenings... Toh Siew Tee, my Bio teacher stopped me after class today and told me I got full marks for the test. And she was giving me this toothy grin that reminded me of Dobby the House Elf. To think Kelvin Chen was actually trying to surprise me by studying and attempting to hit me off the Bio topspot! LOSER! I just have a feeling that the 'Don't talk to me!' is going to come out of my mouth very, very soon...         "
3912317,female,indUnk,"        Well i've been busy with band practice for the past two days. We have a new marching style this year and it's a hard bitch to learn. I'm kinda excited for band camp actually, the music isn't as bad as i thought it would be. It's a circus jazz style, very cool. I hope the n00bs don't fuck it up, they aren't bad but the drumline isn't half as good as it was last year. Dan and Jarell are going on a European tour for Student Ambassadors. I got invited last year but for certain reasons that cannot be named here, I had to turn it down. =(     I'm not too thrilled about band practices (the bugs are one of the reasons), I don't have a lot of friends there, I just noticed that. Jen left for Grandville, and Toni moved back to Philadelphia, and now she's moving to Vancouver, Washington. =( People show such indifference towards me. I have been friends with some of them since I was 11 and then they just walk by me without even saying 'hi' or 'how have you been?'.     I could tell you about each of them, what they do, what they are like, etc. That's why sometimes I'm so quiet, I analyze people without ever talking to them. I see their actions, their reactions, their choices, how they choose their words, how they choose their friends. It's amazing how much you can learn from being an outsider.     I considered quitting the band at some point because to me, the music is just as important as the people you play it with. You don't play as an individual, you play as one, one sound -- one heart. When you know the person sitting next to you despises you, it's hard to enjoy the music and give it everything you have. I don't think I have ever given anyone a reason to dislike me, but it happens. I hate it, because I consider those people my friends yet to them, I'm an enemy. Then again I have never been one to go and make random friends, it's so much easier online, hehe, don't you agree?    I was looking through my old school stuff today, my mom has all my report cards, progress reports, awards, letters, sincr I was in kindergarten in New Jersey. It was weird. I even found my certificate that says i don't have to take the ESL (English as a Second Language) course anymore. How ironic, haha. I speak english so well now. =P I found a lot of things that belonged to my younger brother (the one i haven't seen in years), it made me sad.

Jamie, Jared, and I took a section of a song omitted from the album and turned it into some chemlab goodness. Maybe it will make it onto the album. Jared's voice is in fine shape, he's two songs and a few overdubs away from wrapping the vox up for this beeyotch. Phrase of the day is 'Velveteen Pouch'. Don't ask.

He's an older man that kind of reminds me of Mr. Hendrick. He seems nice enough, just a little talkative. After English I went home and cleaned my room/bathroom and took a shower. Then Mark and I went to my ( . . . ?) Nina's house to give her a bunch of shirts that Donna had asked me to drop off for her brother-in-law. While we were there we decided to pick up a few jigsaw puzzles because she is the queen of them. When I asked her if we could take two or three she said 'Take ten!' so we took 15. That should keep us busy. After Nina's house we went to El Superior to eat cheese enchiladas for lunch. For 15 minutes we were the only people in the entire restaurant. It was really cool. I feel guilty for leaving so much queso left in the bowl. It was so delicious. We walked over to the Pet Shop to look at fish and aquariums because I'm going to buy one soon. Mark pet this hairy pig-dog thing almost the entire time because if he stopped it would bark at him. We went to his house and worked on  urlLink our website  for a few hours. And then we drove to my dad's house. We ate dinner and watched Vegas Vacation. I'll let Mark take it from here.    "

I was discussing animal sounds with one of the Japanese English teachers and mice in Japan go 'chu chu'.   On the topic of animals, there was a bug in my apartment when I came home yesterday.  A rather biggish type bug.  I couldn't squish it with a  urlLink shoe.   So I asked my neighbor to help.  I got the word wrong so at first she thought it was a cockroach and didn't know what to do, but then she saw it and it was a beetle so it was all good cause the kids keep them as pets and her son wanted it.  Thus I was saved.  Also you might be wondering where the birds and slugs part of the title comes in.  There was a slug in the lettuce that my land lady gave me when I went to her house.  Ugh.  I washed the lettuce, but I just couldn't bring myself to eat it after that.  I don't suppose you can really sterilize lettuce can you?  There were ants too, straight from nature that lettuce is.  This reminds me of the time I watched eXistenZ and I couldn't eat chicken for about a month.  No idea how long THIS will take...  And birds... well some of you might remember the little bird that was exploring my house the day after I moved in.  Some may not.  I was taking a nap and I heard scratching besides my head (cause this is Japan and we sleep on the floor) and when I turned I heard a bird take off and fly into the kitchen.  I never did actually SEE the bird in the house, only saw him a few minutes later when he was trying to find a way in the kitchen door.  Maybe to find out what that garganuan thing that scared him was...  Frigger must have been back the other day too, cause there's no other way that bird poop could get into my sink.  At least he had the decency to leave it in an easily cleaned place.  I'm animal bloody central lately.        "

Buses, on the other hand, are a bit of a mystery to me.  I take one bus regularly, but that's it.   urlLink taxis , however, are plentiful, cheap and (once you know a little Korean) pretty easy to use.  Now things are getting a lot easier and logical.  As of today (July 1st) rates will be based on distance traveled rather than number of rides.  This makes sense as it always irked me when you had to pay again to transfer from one bus to another or from the bus to subway (this doesn't happen in Vancouver).  The new system just has you pay for the length of each little trip.  As well, my phone will be able to house my T-Money so I don't need to carry change or fish around for my wallet or 'stored-value' ticket.  (It can even be used in convenience stores and cabs soon! And carry up to 500,000 won, or about 435USD)There's also a color-coding scheme to the buses which may or may not make things easier.  Unless they have little maps on the buses I think most foreigners will find the new system about a confusing as the old, but a lot of that has to do with the language and familiarity with a city/district that covers many, many square kms.

883178,male,Fashion,"           Setting aside for a moment how reluctant I am to accept the word of one marine as gospel truth.  And also neglecting a conversation we could have about media as a tool of propaganda (and guess who wields the tool), let me respectfully and cordially disagree.  Saddam's regime was oppressive and criminal.  There is international (and overwhelming) consensus around that point.  Iraq is well rid of him.  Again, everyone agrees.    This is where the disagreement begins.  Some argue, myself among them, that our justifications for the war were dishonest.    First, if Saddam's oppressiveness is our justification for war in Iraq, two thoughts come to mind.  First, now that he is out of power, why don't we leave?  Second, it's time to start attacking (pre-emptively) all those other countries suffering under fascists.  There are unspeakable tragedies taking place all over the world.  And on the despot depth chart, Saddam wouldn't even be on the JV team.    Second, there is no link between Iraq and Al Queda.  If that was our justification for war, we would be in Saudi Arabia right now.  The link between Saudia Arabia and Al Queda is much more clear and much stronger.  Third, there are (as yet) no found Weapons of Mass Destruction.  After initially discovering them in 1991, we eradicated them and were able to contain Saddam for years.  We pretty much knew he did not have WMD, and that if he did, he had no vehicle to deliver them, which brings me to my next point...  Fourth, there is no evidence that Iraq was (as we were told or 'manipulated into thinking') a direct threat to the United States.  I don't even think an argument could be made that they were a credible threat to Israel. (Some argue that Dr. Paul Wolfowitz and the other neo-cons were really interested in stability in the region and in protecting Israel).  At any rate, as a result, the whole justfication for the war was (at minimum) ill founded and (more likely) fabricated.  If I had a child in the military serving in Iraq, my outcry would be deafening.  I'm all for military service but I can never support the use of our fighting men and women for any cause that is not well founded.  This cause is not well founded.   The reason our soldiers are still being shot  may  have to do with a fanatical minority that hates us, when (perhaps) a majority loves us.  To me, though, it is more likely that now that the despot has fallen, Iraqis want us to get the heck out of there so that they can go about the business of true self rule.  Isn't that another part of our justification for going - to restore Iraq to self rule?  I believe that a lot of Iraqis feel we don't belong there.  They are right, and, to tell the truth, we never did.  They know that our motives are impure.  The whole world knows our motives are impure.  Americans who read the paper know our motives are impure.  And international challenges to prove otherwise have been unanswered by our current administration.   Last, to reply to your side note.  Asking why the poor in this country shoot each other is fine, but we must also ask, more generally, why Americans shoot each other.  There is a lot of violence in our poor communities (I say it is linked to a cycle of violence, a lack of meaningful opportunity, economic injustice, crime, drugs, human frailty, easy access to guns, a culture obsessed with guns, poor leadership and rap music - it's the type of problem it would take about $87,000,000,000 to fix), but there is also a lot of violence in American in general.  Why did Columbine happen?  Why did that one guy shoot his pregnant wife then try to escape to Mexico?  Why did that kid bring a gun to school in Minnesota and kill a classmate and severly wound another?  What explains the snipers?    The way I see it, violence is no longer the exclusive province of the poor. We are a violent people.  Our continued support of the death penalty, our unjust and unjustified pre-emptive strike againt Iraq, our passion for violent games and movies and sports and music, our tendency to shoot each other, it all proves the same point.

And then she didnt turn up today for our test, but the test still is carried out somehow, with another teacher of course. And fair enough, we got the same topic and (hehe I've memorise everything, though I've changed some of the words 'coz I can't seem to remember all...OoPs) I started it quickly...'coz we dont have much time after we came back from the Com Lab...and it left us about 20 minutes to complete it instead of 35!  But half way through, the teacher told us we can use the dictionary! My mouth dropped open! I thought 'Didnt she told us we cannot use it? How come now can use??' Oh&nbsp; well, after all I've memorise most of them, there's no further need for me to get a dictionary now...since there isnt much to be look up in the dictionary. So I quickly finish the letter writing, and was the second to finish, but wasn't the second to hand it in...'Coz I dont want to hand up a piece of work with mistakes! So I counter check it.  Then, the teacher broke out the news that we are having another letter writing test on the upcoming Tuesday...and this time it is the formal type. And we are asked to learn the format ourselves. But as she is kind, she decided to go through with us on behalf of our teacher. And we were asked to stay back after school for 10 minutes to go through it...that wasn't so bad. But the worst has yet to come!  She decided to run to ask the HOD of Chinese Department whether she can ownself conduct the extra lessons with us and then when she ask whether she can trust us on not copying when she leaves...and she choose to trust us! I couldnt believe that! And when she left, everyone started to take out their papers and copy...until she came back. And everyone manages to finish it somehow...not all though. -_-'  Chemistry is the next lesson....I hate it! 'Coz that teacher totally sucks! He teaches so quickly and when students ask questions about it, he will yell at them! How weird! And he always like to pass sarcastic remarks on those he dislike! Thanks god, he dont dislike me...He actually treat my classmate a ghost! And he likes to give nicks to anyone he hates! And sway...when he tested us on the Equations, I got picked! 'Coz I was 16! And 15 didnt come! So he decided on 16! Then i go up, shaking....dont know what to write. I look around asking for help. Got some help from some of them, and then he decided that we can get help from someone...and if we cant complete it by today, all of us have to stay back!   Inorder to get everyone safely back home, I quickly ask the Chemistry Experts! True enough, I got the answers...but whether or not it's right he didnt say. But for the other team, he didnt got it right, and somehow have to stay back for detention. I thought he was going to say 'Who was the other one that was up there, that couldnt answer the question just now?'(me) But I was standing there, praying hard he won't. And whew! He didnt!  I think he either forgotten about me or I really did get the right answers. Haha...  Kinda sway today right? But I cant wait for Sunday! 'Coz I'd be going to the library and borrow some cool books home..And I cant wait for Wednesday Night either! 'Coz my brother is coming back! And then, I can finally get my hands on the gifts he is bringing back! Hehe...I sure hope he got the things I like...  Okay.   Laters!!          "

This is quite an ironic situation with me, because technically I really have my hands full with work or some other activity, but my heart simply is not able to give a 100% to it yet.  No yoga classes for the weekend, so had to practise it at home.  This is one good thing which is happening in my life, brings a certain calmness to my life esp early in the morning.  After a really long time, think a good number of years, I woke up at 9:30am...but then courtesy of waking up so late, I have this headache which is totally irritating...hmm, this is the reason why its' said early to bed and rise & shine!   Dont know whether its early to bed or late to bed which really makes a difference, just feel that if I take more than the quota of 6-7 hours of sleep, I feel miserablly off!  My life appears to have become quite ironical.  There used to be a time when people used to pull my leg for going to sleep at 10pm, haha, and oflate my earliest nap time is infact 11:30/12....so much for being branded as an early bird.  So far the saturday has been a touch boring, just watched a hindi movie, Chalte Chalte, will have the movie review up in my movie blog soon.

4192173,male,Technology,"             Well, I'm still coming down from the Wrestlemania experience. First, hats off to Matt Gentile, who, despite trying to swerve me into thinking he had accidentally burned one of the tickets, really came through big time by getting us 4 excellent seats at MSG. All for, as Dan Hamill would say GRATIS (though he would say it GRATIAS). The show itself was a blast, the crowd was fun and we saw some super wrestling. In particular, Chris Benoit pulled off the big one and  really made the evening special with his big win. Also, in the surreal part of the night, Brock Lesnar, the Next Big Dumbass, was booed out of the building. How stupid is this guy to walk away from the sport that made him tons of money and a star to boot? He's young and will regret this decision. Instead of being the next Kurt Angle, he's for now, the next Ultimate Warrior. He'll be back. Watch.  Anyhow, before all this Mania, I spent my Saturday in a German bar drinking with G and Matt, and later Ash. Also, we ate potato pancakes and 'cupcakes'. This was a good time, nay, a great time. It reminded me of our days abroad. However, the drinks took their toll and after a wine filled dinner with Irene, I found myself drunkenly harrassing tourists in Times Square. Man, that was embarassing, but Irene got a kick out of it and thats enough for me. Then we hit Broadway and saw AVENUE Q, which is amazing and hilarious. SEE THAT. Broadway is in an excellent phase right now with plays like WICKED and AVENUE Q that are very commerical, yet artistic, clever and entertaining. I hate musicals, but I love those.  I have to tease you with some info. A certain pal of mine, known in many circles musically, has reported via a mate that he has contributed to a certain album that will kick major ass this year. I didnt even know these guys were DOING an album. The I-kids are going to be pleased as punch.  F         "
3176655,male,Engineering,"                 I have seen the face of god, and damn that boy is fine.  No really, I went out last night and I have about 30 nightime don'ts for you.  So after I stupidly forgot to get tickets for the hypnotist and Jender went home I went out a bar (yeah, news to whom?).  I want to appologize to everyone I called last night.  Especially e who got a call at like 3, or as I like to call it 90 minutes into my walk home (hang on I'm getting there).    So I'm out at a bar that's playing the gayest moments in movies, or some such shit.  Like the funeral from  Steel Magnolias  the first performance from  Sister Act  etc.  I see the hottest person in the world (my fucking luck, he was a bartender, Mike... Mark... Milk...  It's not important), so I go talk to him.  Long story short I make friends with 3 really hot guys (him his boyfriend, and a friend from NYC).  At least I got to see two really hot guys kiss.    So they invite me to a club, it was fun, but I'm not sure how frequently I can take that.  This was like the hottest selection of guys I've seen in my life, but shallow like a fox.  I need to work out, 'cause just losing weight makes my skinny, but not hot.  These guys were all shirtless and gorgeous, and meanwhile I'm like 'I've had 5 hours of sleep since thursday, gimme a break.'  (So I pretty much fell asleep 4 times on the dancefloor).  Okay I think were ready for the don'ts, this story got boring.    I think the best part of going out is checking your pockets the next day... It's a veritable who's who of crap.    DON'T: 1. Don't go Out to a club with ppl. you've known for like 30 minutes, even if they're hot, 'cause they don't have your back. (okay like 2 hours is okay) 2. Don't call your friend for confirmation of your prettyness on Saturday, 'cause they ain't home, and they just get really worried and call you later when you have no idea who they are and when sequins came back into style. 3. Don't call them at 9 the next morning either, 'cause they're just mad. 4. Don't go to a club on no sleep, 'cause you ain't looking pretty. 5. Just because you see the Washington Monument does not mean you can walk home. 6. When thinking about walking home, call a cab, it's easy to romanticize but 2 hours later when you have the beer shits from the previous night it's not fun. 6. Don't question black earwax... it's just happens sometimes. 7. When your on an exodus walking home and you come across train tracks, find another way, don't hop the fence and narrowly dodge an approching train. 8. Don't 'balance-beam' on a railing 30 feet above traffic, while tango-ing with an oak. 9. Don't go out when you're still hungover, 'cause the beer shits catch up to you while you're walkin' past the Smithsonian. (worth mentioning twice.)    Okay Peace out. Live it Learn it Love it.

When she wasn't 'hanging' out with her previous boyfriend, she was calling me at work threatening to cut herself if I said I'd break up with her.  Yeah...a real keeper.  Well, we were on and off and when we were back on, she decided that she wanted to go on a 'business trip' with her ex-boyfriend.  You know...just as 'friends.'  I wasn't too crazy about the idea.  When I grilled her about the accomodations, I learned that she was indeed staying in a hotel room with him with only ONE bed.  Her logic was: 'Yeah, but you've stayed with your friend in Oregon and she's a girl.'  For the record, I slept in the bottom bunk of her kid's bed.  Not even REMOTELY the same thing.  Despite my pleas for her to not go, she went.  When she came back, I promptly dumped her like a visit to the restroom after eating at Khan's Mongolian BBQ.  The following is an e-mail conversation that transpired weeks after the dump-age..    Crazy:  I'm sorry I called you so late last night. I just wanted to tell you about this dream I had that you were in....blah blah blah blah...   DJS:  What part of 'I DON'T WANT ANYTHING TO DO WITH YOU EVER AGAIN' don't you understand?   2. Have you ever lied to spare feelings when breaking up with someone?   I used to.  I've got this thing in my genetic code where I don't want to let people down, including ex-girlfriends.  The previous story (and yeah, there's a lot more to it) was the exception to the rule.  I don't give two shits about that psycho now.   3. Stevie Wonder says 'there is superstition.' Discuss.

I think they rushed the gig as the sound was a little off, but they have the songs to back it up, so no biggie. South will do nothing in this country simply because they're songs are too intelligent and well-played. But as long as we know them in our own little corner of the world here, its all good. Brandt never showed for this gig because he was too busy working on the album. Now call me crazy, but i don't think thats ever happened in any of my musical projects before.

4192173,male,Technology,"             In response to my previous post, the person I called out on the H-bar board regarding KMFDM's MONEY album has responded and with factual back-up to boot. He pointed me to a recent interview with Sascha KMFDM that gives the whole story: 'In 1991 we started recording MONEY. MONEY was not supposed to be called MONEY. It was supposed to be called SPLIT because En Esch and I decided to break up during the tour with Thrill Kill Kult in 1990. So we decided that our next recording budget would split half and a half. I would get one half and he would get one half and we would both make 5 songs. Back on those days it was all still on vinyl. So he made 5 songs, I made 5 songs and we threw the coin and decided who gets the A and who gets the B side of the record. WAX TRAX rejected B side which was the En Esch's side. They said it didn't sound like KMFDM at all and that they didn't like it.They didn't want to put it out because it didn't meet the criteria of the label. So they gave us more money. That's why we called it MONEY. That record was all about the money. And I finished up the album without En Esch and certainly that was kinda really bad blood between us because he felt sort of rejected.'  This is just a bit of what is probably one of the best interviews I have ever read with Sascha:   http://www.electromeda.net/audio/interviews/sascha_KMFDM.html  It's a good read, though I prefer Lucia interviews. I for one am surprised Wax Trax even rejected stuff back in those days. Discuss. You learn something new every day.

883178,male,Fashion,"            I'm With DJS   I've had a bit of the blogging blues lately, too.  It's not like nothing interesting has been going on, I just have been feeling a little under the weather emotionally.  That's kind of weird for me because I'm usually cheery, cheery, cheery, but after rejection 378 on the job front, one can get a little down in the dumps.  So what's the best remedy for that?  Sitting in a dark theater, with smuggled-in Whoppers (delicious), watching the latest indie flick.  That and catching some interesting films on free cable.  Let me recap:   urlLink Dirty Pretty Things : A very touching and intense movie that does not have a dull moment. It's encouraging to see a movie that ends with people of values prevailing.  This movie brought to light the extent people will go to for freedom and a better life - and how you and I take all these things for granted.  Plus, how can you NOT love Audrey Tatou (of Amelie fame)?   urlLink Step into Liquid : As the tagline says - 'No special effects. No stuntmen. No stereotypes. No other feeling comes close.'  I've never surfed in my life, but after seeing this movie, I definitely want to try it at least once.  And who woulda thunk there actually was surfing off the coast of Lake Michigan in little ol' Sheboygan, WI?   urlLink The Swimming Pool : I saw this movie last night and didn't figure out what really happened until about 5 minutes ago.  Now I want to go out and see it again to catch all the nuances.  Very good, but seems pretentious at first (maybe because it's filmed in France?).   urlLink The Karate Kid : I caught this on ESPN Classic, of all stations.  I swear I hadn't seen this since 1984, so it was a true blast from the past.  (Side note: The first time I saw it I was amongst an all-African American audience in a movie theater in Madison, WI - which was great because everyone was yelling at the screen during the karate tournament scene.)  Little Ralphy Macchio seemed so hunky back then; now he just looks like a total dweeb in a red, plastic jacket.  And seeing him with Elizabeth Shue?  She seemed about 10 times bigger than him - what a weird looking couple.  Needless to say, I enjoyed it very much, even though I was mocking it the whole time.  The ending anthem during the final fight destroyed me: 'You're the BEST, around...nothing is going to ever keep you down!'  Wax on, wax off.   urlLink Van Wilder : I was pretty sceptical about this one when it came on Showtime, but it's a bit of a gem.  Ryan Renold's (Van) comic delivery reminds me of Will Ferrell at his best.  I would call this film a very carass  Animal House  (if that's possible?).  Both the eclair scene and Tara Reid's performance made me gag, but as a whole it was entertaining.  If you want dumb humor, this will deliver.         "

883178,male,Fashion,"           Special thanks to Stoner for performing a vigilante rodent inspection earlier this week (she gave us the all-clear).  My own rodent-removal procedure consisted of hysterical calls to our apartment management company (creatively called Apartment Management Company).  The woman with the lucky job of answering the phones there calmly explained to me that the mouse will eat the poison put out by the exterminator and then leave your apartment to die.  I wasnt quite sold with that premise as Id think a mouse would choose to die in the plush environs of our apartment versus venturing out into the world for one last adventure, but since we have several senior citizens in our building, this lady gets must get away with such tall tales on a regular basis.  Whatever.  To further complicate all this, Ive seen too many Tom & Jerry, Speedy Gonzales, and even Micky Mouse cartoons to begin to think that its a done deal that the mouse will eat the poison, no matter how enticing.  Im nervous that left to its own devices, the little bastard will sneak the poison in my morning coffee and hit me over the head with a giant anvil.   So now that weve confirmed that the only residents of apartment 205 are Stoner and myself, I can look forward to a pleasant weekend.  *sigh*  Further housing lowdown I caught a bit of  urlLink Rear Window  recently, and it has me even more suspicious of the clowns across the hall.

2844168,female,Marketing,"                 Well the last half of the week flew by! Wednesday and Thursday I worked on Dad's books again and finished up one. The other one I'm just waiting on a few final things from him. I also got back into the gym this week. That felt good. After 4 weeks of being away from my regular diet and exercise routine, it felt great to get back into the swing of things. Thursday evening we headed over to Life Group and had a great time with them as always. It was nice to see everyone again. I hadn't been there in 5 weeks! It was funny to note that in those 5 weeks they only finished 2 lessons, so I wasn't too far behind. I think we're going to be in Romans for a loooong time!  Yesterday Ked and I headed out to Orlando early afternoon. We had planned to attend a free Photoshop seminar that we figured was going to be a three hour sales pitch, but would probably teach us some things about the new version of the software that we didn't know yet. We got to the Orange County Convention Seminar, which is absolutely gorgeous, and discovered they wanted $10-15 for parking. We decided we didn't want to pay $10-15 to park for a free seminar/sales pitch for software we already own. So we skipped it and got an early start on the rest of our plans for the day! We headed down the street to the Pointe. It's a cool little outdoor shopping mall that we had heard about, complete with an upside down building fun house. We grabbed a light lunch at the Dan Marino cafe and then saw a matinee of the Bourne Supremacy. Excellent movie! They tied things up so well, I'm still wondering what they'll do for the third movie.  After the movie we wandered around the strip a little and then headed over to the Premier Outlet stores. We always hear everyone talking about the good deals there. It was another nice outdoor mall, and half the stores aren't really outlet stores, just regular stores. But the ones that are outlet stores had some great deals going on. Florida has had no sales tax for the past week and until August 1st on school supplies and clothing and footwear under $50. Thank you tourists for your money so we don't have to pay state or local income tax and giving us a statewide surplus of funds!! We didn't buy anything, but we did have a great time wandering and noting certain store for future needs. Then we headed home and it took us twice as long as it should have thanks to wonderful I-4. It's 9 p.m. and we're crawling. Go figure. Florida has no clue how to handle road construction. They need to take some lessons from Michigan. Anyway, we had a great all-day date!!  Not too much going on today. I think we'll be running a few errands and hopefully Ked will be building me a little stool so I won't have to jump into bed anymore! =)                "
3477296,male,Student,"                 Okey dokey, i'm sitting in Gordon Library and talking to Ken over e-messenger. I'm using e-messenger because the library computers are so restricted it won't even let me check my e-mail. So why am i sitting in Gordon Library at 3 'o' clock in the afternoon? Well today i spent the whole day at Macquarie University for Japanese continuers day. It was pretty interesting, worth missing school over. Anyway it ended at 2 and i got a lift with Ken to Gordon station, where i'm waiting for my environmental science book to return to me. I could be home, but i'm here instead. Walking into the library at 2:30 was a bit strange. All the librarians and people were giving me weird looks that said 'why the hell are you here, shouldn't you be at school?'. Libraries are so empty during the day. Funny moment: when David Kim got the phone number of a Hornsby Girl he thought he knew from somewhere.       "
766556,female,indUnk,"        Almost perfect   The Diva had a date.  I know, you're thinking, 'Of course she did.  As fab as she is, she must go out on dates all the time.'  Yeah, whatever.  Anyway, I was invited to a holiday party on Saturday night, and I have to say it was one of the best dates I have been on in years, perhaps ever.  We went to a company holiday party, where I sat at a boring table with extended warantee salesmen and a very spoiled wife.  Listened to a speech about how great the 'team' is doing, yadda yadda.  The most interesting part was when I met a guy who went to my high school and graduated 11 years before me.    But I got to dance to one of my most favorite slow songs ever, 'Lady in Red' - I just love that song and I've never had the opportunity to dance to it (with another person that is).  And my friend was funny and charming and such a gentleman.  Helped me with my coat, made sure I was comfortable, offered to get me drinks from the bar.  Just the perfect date.  Then, he took me to a Wine Bar, owned by a friend of his.  Now, not only am I a diva, but my alter ego is a wine diva!  So, I was in heaven!  They had a wine list to die for!  After drooling over the list, I selected a glass of a French Chardonnay called Fat Bastard.  I couldn't resist the name!  It was really very good.    We sat outside, in very chilly weather, and kept cozy next to a wood burning stove and talked for a long time.  It was such a great evening, and he thanked me for making his night so special.  Sounds great, right?  Well, as this entry's title implies, it was almost perfect.  Unfortunately, I don't see this friend in a romantic light.  He's very nice, attractive, tall, etc.  But, no chemistry.  Damn, imagine that wood burning stove with a little chemistry.  *sigh*  But, most importantly I was on a date instead of home alone.  And it was a great evening.  Diva out.           "
3936869,female,indUnk,"       I used to think I'd whore my poetic tapestry to the first taker.  Now I know it's not true. Rather: I now know I'd tax he nude in my bed. No, no, what's the word? Ah,  welcome . I would welcome the nude in my bed, if only it weren't...Thursday.  A poem from 'Hymns for the Drowning' by Nammalvar:  Before I could say,    'He became cowherd        fish         wild boat,' he became a million million.  or, perhaps, a favorite favorite? So which of us is drowning baby?  I had a rare encounter today with a dark and evil thought that rang truly true like a newly acquired familiarity, and now, I am on the rampage.  Furthermore: Alan Keys told the world today that Obama's position on abortion is akin to that of the slave traders--let the people decide, never mind what our moral commitments are. It's an oddly affable argument. I can't seem to stop smiling. If only there were no morality to the other side of things, the argument would actually shtim. As it stands, Keys looks a bit silly. Like the authors of the Talmud--'certainly it is our perogative to decide whose life is worth more, the mother or the baby. After all, we are MEN!'  But, as my Rebbe Miriam says, sarcasm is not an argument. So here's the argument: fuck off. Don't tell me you want to marry me and then leave me a $50 tip when I can't throw it back in  your face because of my credit card debt. Can't you see that the sight of you makes my knees shake, and bile rise in my throat?!? I hate you all.     "

I'm so happy to have the people that I love so much, who mean so much to me.  I'm happy to have the tasks I have to be doing.  People keep telling me I go around looking like I'm glowing, because I'm so happy.  This world is too beautiful to waste my time here being unhappy.  When I was at World Youth Day, Alexandro {a guy we met there...}  called me 'the Smiley girl'.  At the time I thought that was an insult, but now I see that it was really an extremely nice complement {well, he didn't mean it that way, he DID mean it as an insult but hey...} I wish I could give people little slices of sunshine, and rain showers with a little thunder on the side... maybe a few hugs and a kiss, a years supply of friendly smiles from people you don't even know, and perhaps then all people could be happy like me.

589736,male,Technology,"           I enjoyed it, mainly because I'm a fan of the book.  I think I'll have to reserve my judgment until the longer DVD release.  It has been established now with LOTR that what appears in the theater is not the film, but a conscious abridgement.  It is not the finished work.  Take a moment and think about that:  the artist first publishes/presents a conscious abridgement of the actual work, agreed upon by all parties involved, who know and accept that what was really completed will be released in a different format in a few months.  Not a Director's Cut, not Lost Chapters, not a reassessment now that time has passed.  A conscious, fully intended abridgement.  Released first.         "

They could certainly have met before, possibly as pilot and paying passenger.  It would push the irony angle a bit much for me if Chewie had met Annakin before, and thus served as co-pilot for his son on the way to the Death Star.

2844168,female,Marketing,"                  Look out here we come!   It's not often that I read something so funny that I laugh til I cry. Today was one of those rare moments. I received my new issue of Today's Christian Woman and one article titled 'Been there survived that' had me in stitches. Unfortunately, TCW still has last month's magazine posted on their site, but if I ever see that article show up I'll link to it. This author gave her top 10 mothering tips. She has 2 busy boys now aged 10 and 8 and her stories were so hilarious I was crying. I think what made it so funny was all I could think of was Ked and his brothers Kurt and Ken. Her stories sounded an like the stunts those three would pull (or sometimes what Ked pulled on the twins!) and as I read this lady's story I kept thinking of those 3 at that age. It's a good thing my mother-in-law has a good sense of humor. I'm sure that helped keep her sane.  Another funny story is our mattress was delivered today. Well, I suppose it's not funny that they delivered it, but the rest of the story is funny. After they left I'm eyeing the mattress. We went from a normal mattress to a pillow top. For those of you who haven't seen the awesome bed frame Ked and his Dad built, our bed sits pretty high. We have 6 huge drawers under each side of the bed and we designed it so the bed sat about hip level. Well this new mattress is at LEAST twice as thick as the old one, so it now sits a couple inches higher than my waist. I now have to take a few steps back and get a running start to jump into bed!! I'm just kidding...kind of...I do have to do a little hop to get on top! I called Ked this afternoon and said 'Ummmm, honey, I think we're going to have to get a stepping stool so I can get into bed!!' It's really funny, but it looks great. In fact, I need to finish this up so I can go to bed. I can't wait to sleep on it!  Tonight Ked and I had our TV graphics class at the Public Access station. I mentioned that probably a month ago how we were working to get certified to produce tv shows. It was a lot of fun tonight because the class was just the two of us since two others didn't show. It was easy and we now have our graphics certification. Our next class is next week and it's on editing. We're still tossing around ideas for a program, but we think we're narrowing it down.  In other not so cool news, I think I have the hives! I haven't had hives since I was in the first grade (I was allergic to my teacher!). I don't know why I have them, but I'm trying to get to the bottom of it. Every day for about the past couple weeks, I wake up with itchy spots of little bumps and a rash like surrounding it. Today upon examining them I'm pretty sure it's hives; it's definitely not bug bites. It's usually been just a small spot and is mostly gone by afternoon, but today I woke up and had a lot more than usual of them on both arms and my neck, and although they went down this afternoon they're still there and slightly itchy tonight. Ked and I've been racking our brain and neither of us can think what might be causing them. I haven't changed any of my laundry products, or my diet, and I'm not stressed. They show up every morning, so today I washed everything on our bed - the mattress pad and sheets and pillows. It's weird. Any ideas??  Anyway, I'm taking my itchy self to bed!! buh-bye!               "

Well if that is the case, today was a good day indeed. Started on a note of esteem self control [withheld from public display] and then went out with me spending a substantial time on my Strat Man project. The assignment was to prepare an industry note. All i was doing was going through several industry analysis and trying to figure out the same .... well in other words i was cutting and pasting. But somehow in the middle i realized that i know more now than what i knew during my summers (which were incidently in the same industry as the one i am working for: Telecom). Well how so ever incremental, i got to know more about things and the industry. Its not exactly fraud. Yes people are right, there is a lot of fraud around, and if you are reading this nakul i buy your argument about this. but then i still see the zeal in you to make a difference here and honestly speaking people need to keep upto their levels of zeal at all places ......   regarding knowing someone more, i had a long chat with manjari, and the best part is that i think i know her more now. no it is nothing drastic, but now i understand several of her actions over the 4 years we have been together .... i truly like the female and what she does to me when i am with her in whatever way !

3581210,male,InvestmentBanking,"             Ok, you're probably looking at that title and wondering what the heck the connection is. It's tenuous, but here goes. First, these are four countries I likely will not drive in (although I did drive in the Philippines, or Phil, but that was in my younger days) the first three because of the amount of nuttiness I've either witnessed or assumed is there and the last one because I don't think I'd spend much time away from the beach.   Ok, so about this Korean driving stuff. I've been here for almost 2 years and always get the question: 'do you have a car?' My answer, I think, is pretty logical. No, because (i) the subway system here is cheap, easy and pretty fast (no traffic); (ii) the bus system is not prefect, but once you know which one to take it's quite nice; (iii) our firm has a driver and  urlLink Hyundai   urlLink Equus  for visits on company business; (iv) taxis are everywhere in this city and are pretty inexpensive; (v) my work is like 20 meters from home; and (iv) driving here is not like in Canada (either I'd cause an accident here or get used to this way and cause one when I drive back home). Thus, no need for a car. Actually, I try to stay off the roads whenever possible here.   Perhaps this is for good reason, Korea has one of the highest traffic fatality and injury record in the developed/developing world. It's really quite amazing. Take a look at these articles ( urlLink here  and  urlLink here ) and you'll see what I mean. One reason is  urlLink many Koreans do not use seatbelts  (another article  urlLink here ). Even I don't, when I'm in the back seat--especially of a taxi. It's really quite odd (and scary) that I always buckle up at home but take my life into my own hands when I'm here...perhaps simply because everyone does it here.   People who do come here to drive have to get used to the rules of the road, as described in  urlLink this article  from the U.S. Embassy in Seoul. And if you hit someone the driver is almost always at fault in some respect (more on that  urlLink here ).   So, what's the connection to Greece?  urlLink Korean drivers licenses will be considered valid in Greece . I'm not sure why, it certainly isn't valid in Canada, you have to do a new test and everything there, but for some reason Greece has opened the doors for Koreans to take to its streets, probably because of the Olympics. ( urlLink Apparently Greece is famous for some crazy driving as well .) But then, isn't that a brutal time for Koreans (or any foreigners) to be tooling around town in a rental? Oh well, I'm certainly not going to Greece anytime soon, and if I did I'd probably call  urlLink George the Super-Cabbie .   So, on to Phil.

It was about a 3 hours trip on provincial (read: rural, goat/dog/child/rickshaw-strewn) road and on the way back Carlo was at the wheel. For some reason a dog was on the road and Carlo tried to avoid it (really, he did swerve like 3 times, the thing just changed direction again!) but, in the end, it became one with the rubber. Also, a kid jumped on the road and pointed a gun at us (I hope it was a toy, but you never know). With that I started to really question why I'd be at or near the wheel of a vehicle in Phil or any other developing country.   Carlo and I returned to Canada safely and got back to work at  urlLink RBC Dominion Securities  where we worked (did I note that we started on the same day and had the same briefcase?) but within 2 years the both of us made moves to other firms. I was in Canada a while longer before coming here and Carlo went to first  urlLink Turks & Caicos Islands  then to  urlLink Cayman Islands . He left then returned to RBC and, as you can see from the pics below, is an avid flagger, I mean flag football player.  Ya, he goes long on the field and goes short in the office.  (haha! a little finance/hedge fund humor there for ya!)   urlLink     Watch out Carlo! Looks like that big dude's got your number! Good thing it's flag football.    Right now he's Player of the Week! Way to go Carlo! His profile is  urlLink here  and his league's site is  urlLink here  (Carlo, why is the domain dot K-Y??). Oh, and ladies, too late, he has a girlfriend and a baby on the way.    urlLink     Lookin' a little rotund there, Carlo.   Well, that's the story, from crazy driving to driving to the end zone in one blog.          "

1103575,female,indUnk,"       Its amazing how some of the littlest things can change your point of view.   I've been in a much better mood lately {which unfortunately means less to write about...}  and I can't decided if its because of the lovely weather, or because of Sean.  Probably both.  and the other day Mr. Thomas suggested that he thinks going to MU {University of Missouri, Columbia} would be really good for me.  His opinion means a lot to me.  Therefore, I am going to visit there next week, during spring break. He also said that one of the photos I took for the issue that's coming out tomorrow is the best I've had published all year.    Tonight I went to a Lenten prayer service at church.  They played a video on poverty around the world.  It was terribly depressing.  If I give up all the things I own, how would that help the  people who live in garbage dumps in South America?  Could I sell my car, and donate the money from it, and the gas money I would save to a charity?  I don't think I could.   I'm too selfish.  The thought makes me sick to my stomach.   I do feel a little less stressed though...  I got some good prayer time in.  I always feel so much cleaner after I've prayed.  Lately, my prayers have just been letting my thoughts flow through my head,  opening them to God, and dwelling on people who I care about,  who need my prayers, and who I am thankful for.  Then I've fallen into my faults.  I wish there was some way I could force myself to be more selfless.  I want to exist soley for the good of others, but somehow I always fall back to doing things for my own good, and taking care of my wants.  I feel guilty for wanting so many things, especially when I know how little they really matter.  I also feel guilty for needing so much attention.  So much of what I do is to get the attention and compliments of others.  Does any of the good I do for this  purpose even really count?  I talk about people behind their backs, and I judge people based on the way they look or talk.    Honestly?  I think I really am a terrible person. God help me.    "
3359005,male,Student,"             Amazing Race's Sports Injury by  Ethan Alter    The Amazing Race's father-daughter duo, Jim and Marsha, got off to the roughest start of any team. After Jim took a tumble on the Santa Monica boardwalk and ripped up his knee, they were forced to go to the hospital, and nearly missed the first airline flight of the race. But they never gave up, battling their way into third place on the second leg. Their luck gave out Tuesday night though, as plane problems grounded them for good.     Ethan: So Jim, how's the leg?     Jim:  Oh, it's fine now. The stitches actually popped out five minutes after we were on the airplane. At that point, I was just concerned about infection, so I was taking antibiotics. Eventually, it went away and now I've got a nice souvenir scar.   Marsha:  He doesn't have feeling in the top of his kneecap though. He never mentions that part. But that's my dad, I guess.    Ethan: I'm still impressed that they were able to sew your wound up so quickly.     Jim:  That's actually a funny story. The nurse was taking her time, and I knew I had to get her on my side. She said, 'I don't understand why you just can't take the next flight to Uruguay.' So I said, 'You don't understand, I have to get on that flight. I didn't want to tell you this, but I'm a producer and I'm filming a show in Uruguay. My camera crew is already on that plane. It's going to cost millions and millions of dollars if we have to delay the production.' And she goes, 'What kind of show are you making? Is it some sort of animal show?' I saw a spark in her eye and said, 'Yes, it's an animal show.' She said 'Oh, really?' and then ran and got another doctor and a paramedic and all three of them did the procedure together. And then she said, 'Okay, you go ahead and produce your show, but no running and no jumping.'   Marsha:  She gave him a narcotic for pain and Dad threw it away because he didn't want to have a fuzzy head. All that injury and no pain medicine, I was so proud of him. We felt so victorious walking to the flight — I could hear the Rocky music in my head!       Ethan: Settle another issue: Did those bowling moms lie to you?     Marsha:  We still don't know. We overheard them talking to some locals, but they weren't discretely talking to them. It was like they were trying to lure other teams into listening, and I totally fell for it. After we got to the exchange booth and no one else was there, we figured they had tricked us. But then we wound up beating them to the pit stop and we thought that maybe we were just so wrapped up in the race that we misunderstood. We never confronted them about it and they probably had no hand in it. I can't wait to talk to them and say, 'We're sorry for saying such nasty things about you!'    Ethan: What happened to you at the Buenos Aires airport? That was confusing.     Marsha:  I told the woman behind the counter to book us on the 9:10 flight, but there was only one seat left. So I had her book me on that flight and put Dad on the standby list. I also asked her to confirm us for the 10:30 flight. I think confusion arose because Brandon and Nicole — whom I never should have helped in the first place after they screwed us over on the first leg — asked us to buy their tickets, too. So now I'm asking for a lot of tickets, and I guess the lady got confused. In her mind, she said, 'Well, Marsha's got a ticket for the 9:10, so I'll put Jim and Brandon and Nicole on the 10:30.' So I think we're set and then Dad sees that I don't have a ticket for the 10:30 flight.   Jim:  She made the mistake of not giving us the tickets that we asked for and I made the mistake of not checking the tickets at the counter. Once we got back to the counter and realized she wasn't going to admit her mistake, we got the airport manager in on it and even she couldn't do anything. But we still didn't think we were sunk because we were first on the standby list for the 10:30 flight. So we get to the gate and they start calling out all the standby passengers, except us. We asked what was going on and the guy didn't even look at us. It was very apparent that we were not getting on that plane. He took Kami and Karli ahead of us, even though we were first on the list. I don't know how that happened. They may have done something behind the scenes that we didn't see.  Marsha: Or maybe he just thought blonds were cuter than brunets. [Laughs]    Ethan: You got on the 11:30 plane instead. Did you have any hope of catching up?     Marsha:  The episode didn't indicate this, but our plane was actually delayed for another 30 minutes. Once we landed, we ran a really quick race. If it wasn't for those 30 minutes, I think we could have caught up to Marshall and Lance. The producers even told us later that we were really close to beating those guys.           "

4291530,female,indUnk,"   Hello all,  This is the first post on my blog I made to keep everyone in touch with what Jeff and I are doing out here in Maryland. I know we don't keep in touch as much as we'd like to, and I thought that this would be a good thing to let everyone know what's been going on with us. So, just a quick overview and then I'll get up to date.  Jeff and I moved out to the east coast almost exactly a year ago. Although at the time we moved to Virginia to a nice apartment complex called Windsor at Potomac Vista in Woodbridge. It was a cute, 2 bedroom apartment on the second floor with a washer and dryer! My favorite thing in that apartment. We stayed there about 8 months and then moved to Maryland.  Why did we move? Well, in those 8 months that we lived there, Jeff got a job as a systems engineer at Lockheed Martin ( urlLink http://www.lockheedmartin.com ). The job was in Gaithersburg, MD and we thought it wouldn't be too bad of a commute for Jeff so that we could stay where we were. Boy were we wrong! He had a 2 and half hour commute one way, so that was 5 hours a day he spent trying to go places. We thought, 5 hours driving, 40 hour work week, and him going to school full time was too much. So we moved.  We decided to buy a house because the interest rates were fantastic and we would be paying just as much with rent as a mortgage payment. So we took the plunge! We used Weirchrt Relators and found the house we bought the very first day out looking. It was just what we were looking for. 3 bedrooms, 2 and a half baths, with another washer and dryer. Very important, those washer and dryers. :) So on April 1, 2004, we closed on the house and moved in! Jeff now only drives 10 minutes to work every day and is able to go home for lunch every day. Lucky dog.  So that pretty much brings us up to speed on where we are. Now on to what we're doing. We bought a Cairn Terrier puppy soon after moving to our house. We named her Dogwood Cinderella, Cinder for short. She was so sweet as a tiny puppy, and now she's just so much fun. She loves people and can do all sorts of tricks. She can sit, stay, lay down, speak, and shake. The shake is adorable but she sits and lays down the best.  We just celebrated our 3rd anniversary with a trip to West Virginia. It was beautiful. This summer has been nice and restful.  Coming up in our lives is school for Jeff. He'll continue at George Washington University as a grad student. This will be his last full year. I continue to work at Genetics and IVF ( urlLink http://www.givf.com ) in Fairfax, Virigina, making apointments for either infertility and prenatal genetic testing. Boy have I leared a lot!  We've been enjoying our time here in Maryland! More updates to come!  "

2821801,female,indUnk,"           Didn't intend for  urlLink my comments to this post  to be construed as a publicity stunt, but referrer logs don't lie.  I'll see if I can get a post together at some point in my busy day to discuss what I feel defines a true 'hero'.  FWIW I think this all comes down to the old liberal trick of bastardizing language ( urlLink case in point ) to justify means to an end.  For, unfortunately, I look around me these days, and I don't see any hero's.  Our ADD-ridden society is serverely deficient in the 'conviction' department, and to this jaded 25 year old, hero's appear to be a thing of the past.  Adding insult to injury, the more we try and seek hero's in our everday lives (to make ourselves feel better that we're not completely fucked) - the more we cheapen the concept and spiral further away from the essence of 'heroism'.  More to come.   I guess the best quick analogy I can come up with is the William Wallace example - the character Mel Gibson played in Braveheart.  I think this is the first image that comes to peoples minds when they hear about the defiant Italian who was un-ceremoniously  urlLink shot in the neck  by human filth, the same murder Al Jazeera is touting as 'too violent' for their animalistic audience.    An interesting thing was happening in the comments section of Allah's post noted above - people started calling this courageous soul a  hero .  While that was also my initial gut reaction, I changed my mind when I started thinking about it.  I empathize with the bandwagon jumpers - they want to make a martyr out of this man.  Whether your motivation is to get angry at Muslims, or feel superior to them, or simply to feel SOMETHING about what happened - we should put those things aside if we're going to label one man, above all other comers a hero.  What he did was defiant?  Yes.  Courageous?  Yes.  Noble?  Very much so.  Heart wrenching?  Fuck yes.  Heroic?  No.    I'd put forth the only argument that could be made that this man be recognized as a hero would be for his ability to view his situation with an unclouded mind, and recognize, with 100% clarity the extent of his situation and turn it into the absolute best thing possible.  However, in my opinion, that earns my deep-seated respect (and it's not an outburst I'll likely forget for the rest of my life - for this certainly is one of those things we'll tell our grandkids), but not the exalted title of Hero.

766556,female,indUnk,"        An Epiphany  Fred, you probably should stop reading this right now. I know how you hate it when I get philosophical.  But I had an epiphany last night.  I was practicing yoga and almost ready to go into the rest pose when it hit me.  I've always said that pain is a warning, but I never really fully understood that, until last night.   I didn't hurt myself or anything.  I was sitting with my legs (almost) in lotus, with my forehead resting on the floor.  And I had this urge in the back of my head to sit up.  I resisted as long as I could, but then I realized that I needed to sit up.  The urge was strong enough to push me up.    In that position, I always think about being a seed buried deep in the dirt.  What makes it want to grow?  It must be that urge to rise.  The hunger and need to change and grow.  You know how an old pair of shoes can just start to hurt?  Time for new ones.  Or when those size 6 jeans just don't fit anymore?  Time to acknowledge there's been a change, and react with a change of jeans.    On a deeper level, sometimes when we feel like something just isn't right it's because we need to grow, to make a change.  The hard part isn't only noticing the hurt, but also figuring out what's causing the hurt.  Discovering what needs to change can be so very hard.  But, once you figure it out, the ache goes away.  That little urge inside you, bugging the hell out of you, quiets down and goes away when you've taken the right action and made the right change.  Everything changes, and when we don't change too, it just hurts.  Diva out.            "

4192173,male,Technology,             Today is 9/11.  I am happy to be alive and be the luckiest fucker alive.  To life. Drink up.  F  PS: Christian Bale is Batman. inspired choice.          
3369668,male,indUnk,"   This is my first entry. I have long wanted to a place write down my thoughts but have never gone through with the process. Today I saw an article on Yahoo that talked about this web site and decided this would suit my needs just fine.  Today is my last Monday working for this company. I am a production planner. The company is closing operations in Mexico and our office, located in San Antonio, is no longer needed. I have worked for this company for twelve years, initially in Laredo Texas, and, for the last 10 years in San Antonio.  Losing my job has me filled with anxiety. I have two children, a nine year old son and a seventeen year old daughter. Although my wife has a good job, I am unsure of what our future will be. My daughter will be a senior in high school next year and will go to college the year after. How we'll pay for that I do not know.  My dad worked as a lithographer and lost his job when I was the same age my daughter is now. We moved to a little town in Illinois where I finished school. My senior year of high school was six weeks long. I had enough accumulated credit from the district I was in to graduate in Illinois and only had to wait through a probationary period to receive a degree. Knowing money was tight, I never asked about going to college but rather started working. My first job was with a company in Merriam Kansas near where I grew up. Finding myself in the same position now as dad was then is really scary. We kids never knew how difficult it was for him.  On one hand I am sure all will turn out well and on the other I am consumed with guilt for failing my family. I worry about how we will survive financially and how we will give to our children the things we want to give them. I look at mom and dad today and see two people that have survived the years still waking each day happy and with a bright outlook. I know, I hope, I will be the same when I am their age.  One of my brothers is currently searching for a job and it worries mom and dad so much I am reluctant to tell them about me. I feel so alone not sharing this but don't want to add the stress to their lives. They will probably be upset when they do learn of this but I'll accept that when it comes.  Luckily, the company is giving me a generous severance package which will keep us afloat until Christmas. I have started searching for jobs here in San Antonio. I will probably have to take a job outside my experience at much less money. Finding work would be easier if I looked outside the city, or better, outside the state. I won't do that as I have promised my daughter I would not move the family before she graduated from high school.    "

2635745,female,Student,"       Wow!  Its like all of a sudden I feel sad.  I don't know what it is.  Maybe because I've had this happy high for about a month.  Or maybe because I feel like I'm growing apart from a certain person.  I see him everyday when I walk to Biology.  He's always talking to this one girl.  And sometimes I think if only we were in the same grade.  But then I run into Jacob and Jake and they're both sophmores and have always taken time to say hi or comment on my hair.  I dunno Jake told me my hair looked nice once.  But why the fuck cant he ever say something nice during school.  On the weekends and on trips I think could you flirt anymore,  but then like a meathead he can't talk to me in front of other girls in his class.  It sucks.  But I did tick him off the other day.  I was walking to class and I saw Matt Grimes and he was walking in front of Matt and I said hey to Matt and I talked to him a bit, because he never talks to anyone.  Plus I think it gave him an ego boost because he despises him.  But I blew him off like he blows me off.  That showed him.  And Matt would never act in a weird way if I said hello.  No telling what the other person would do.  He does come and talk to me in the hall though sometimes.  Michael is becoming a closer friend.  I can tell because he will smile at me in the halls.  He never used to do that.  Huh.  Well I feel a little better.  Maybe things will look up at Gatlinburg.  Three days of competeing, fun, flirting, and him.         "

Anyway, we had an argument over whether it is wrong to freedom kiss on the second date (he said no - but he's kind of slutty).  I said yes...no freedom kissing until the third of fourth date.  Later, we discussed the merits of the freedom cut bikini.    Okay, that was sarcastic.  All I am saying is this:  without french fries and vodka, my life is dimished significantly.  So, if France and Russia veto U.N. Resolution 1441 and the patriotic thing to do is ban all things Russian or French, then I'm going to be one brie eatin', fry snackin', vodka drinkin', unpatriotic so and so.         "

I was a squeaky clean nerd, and I kept not knowing what she saw in me.  I was awkward around her much of the time, and she did not respond well to my number one source of comedy...sarcasm (I've outgrown that sarcasm thing BTW).    We rode the same bus, and she lived not too far away.  She was older than me (a trend) and a Leo (another trend), and I was crazy about her even while I was confused (still another trend).  Tempest ushered in a new era for me.  Prior to hanging out with her, I was a model rocket (Dr. Freud white courtesy phone please...Dr. Freud white courtesy phone) fiend.  But after Tempest, it was all girls, all the time (trend).  Sometimes she would come over to go for a swim.  A couple of times, I would ride my Schwinn the two miles to her house (her mom hated me).  I got a car while we dated, and though I had a restricted license, I drove to her house once or twice too.  We hung out for a few months, and I learned a lot.  Some things shareable, some not. She eventually broke up with me to date a guy with a better body and a darker reputation (trend), and I remember being both heartbroken and pragmatic (I couldn't imagine us running away together or anything) (trend).  I still have a hair ribbon that she wore to my house one night, and I still remember that she used to wear this body spray that smelled wonderfully. Right now, I can't remember what it was called (three initials like FDS or something), but it was ATR when I was a school boy.   Sometimes, every once in awhile, I wonder where she is and what she is doing (trend).         "

3536864,male,Student,"       Hey, it's been a bit. Wow, King Arthur was the last entry. Ok time to update some.  A few things have happened in that time space.  One of the most important is that I've obtained  the  actual sheet music for  the  actual Maple Leaf Rag. Interesting name: yes.  Awesome skill requirement and totally rewarding song: yes. So it evens itself out.  In fact, i'm listening to a clip of that song right now.  Absolutley amazing.  Also in that time space was the action packed Friday. I had a birthday party I had to go to, and immideatly after that some of my friends had a gig at a coffee shop. The well known Kaffe Bona.  I took a ride with a friend (Some call him.....tim?) and not only was he conveniently going to the birthday party right after practicing for the gig at my house, but he was also playing at the gig after the birthday party, so getting a ride wasn't an obstacle.  After the birthday party which conveniently provided dinner, i didn't even plan to eat anything and I still got food, we played poker and did the whole present thing....except i forgot mine...but that will change soon. I played some piano and was out the door to walmart.  Tim's fingers were pretty much eaten away the by the guitar strings, so we needed superglue so his fingers wouldn't hurt and he could solo.  Off to walmart, off to....which aisle would superglue be in? Tim thought that the aisle with medical supplies would work, cause if you get a cut you need something that will stay on it right? I told him that the rest of the civilized world used band-aids...except for his neighbor , then told him that we needed to go through teacher supplies.  So we did, and in the middle of his sentence about why woud someone put superglue in the teacher supplies there it was. Score.  Got the glue now on to the cash register! We found an empty express lane, but the guy had to go find a ten dollar bill for change, so we ended up waiting for around three minutes.  Once we were in the car, we had to maneuvre through the parking lot full of medians. Kaffe Bona was packed. It's a relatively small place to begin with, but with this many people (they raked in quite the audience...and money for Kaffe Bona coffee) it was rather stuffy. First, there was a group playing ahead of us.  They were going to play for about 15 minutes, then the  real  show would begin.  It was horrid.  I mean, really horrid. I had to tell my friends that were there to dismiss the first group because Ryan's group was nothing like this.  Just to give you an idea of how deranged they were, first you couldn't hear the girl on vocals, second the guitarist was repetitive, third the third guy had a 20 key keyboard he kept trying to make weird sounds off of, and was throwing light bulbs into a box so they would break and make noise. He did this repeatedly with three lightbulbs, a cell phone, then finally dropped the entire box of lightbulbs.  However this missed the box and hit the floor because he wasn't looking where he was dropping, but was smiling at the crowd.  Not only that, be he had the oddest 'hat.' It looked like an oversized, confused pop corn kernel gone wrong.  And it was brown.  A second song they played was even worse...if that's possible.  The guitarist was playing, and the third guy was was running a power drill next to the pick-up just to make noise. Really hideous.  Then Something else started playing....yeah, that's the name of Ryan's band.  So when you're in the car and someone says ,' Dude, put something else on.'  You'll know what to do.  Yeah, i thought it was cheesy too, i had the great name of Acoustic Cappuchino, but no.  Anyway, throught that time i listened, talked, and surfed the web. Cause it's an internet cafe as well.  Some people from the birthday came too, because we invited them and Tim and I know just about all of them...which is why we were there... All in all, it was a good jam. We packed up, got some free stuff since I was with the band, and went home.             So that is the account of that Friday...i'll come back and post a bit later with the rest.          "
766556,female,indUnk,"        Wise words  First of all, let me say that I totally dig the new blogger look.  It will be interesting to see how many bugs are included with the new look.  Now, for those wise words.  And from an unlikely source.  There's this song on Radio Disney, I think by Hilary Duff (all parents reading this right now know EXACTLY who and what song).  This very young and not-very-world-weary child sings this wisdom into my ear at least twice a day, and I can't help but wonder who actually wrote it.  'Why not take a crazy chance?... If you miss a moment, you might lose alot; so why not?'  Pretty much describes my whole outlook on life.  But then, I'm more upbeat and carefree than most grown-ups I know ;)  Diva out.           "

I loved the Coehlo book, The Pilgrimage.  I have to read more of his work, it touches on the magic that moves around and through each of us every day.  Very inspiring.  Now, I'm reading Whence the Goddesses, A source book.  This thing is fascinating.  Its more like a text book on Indo-European history and mythology, and it touches on some of the information I already knew on a few classic goddesses, like Athena and Aphrodite.  But it offers so much more details on all of the major goddesses that were worshipped throughout history, up to today.  I'm really enjoying reading it.  I have also picked up a collection of plays by Moliere.  I wanted to read Tartuffe, but the Main Library downtown never has any of the books I'm looking for.  So, I have Don Juan and a few other plays.  I'm looking forward to reading it after the Goddesses.  Now, I have tons of work to do.  My boss took yesterday off, since it was his birthday.

Play with a killer band in a sold-out, big huge arena outdoors, like Soldier Field in Chicago. On a more realistic note closer to home, I'd like to play the main room at First Ave.   2. When someone asks your opinion about a new haircut/outfit/etc, are you always honest?   No. I try to minimize hurting people's feelings so I try to find something positive and confusing to say. Them: 'Hey do you like my haircut?' Me: 'Haircuts are indicative of change and I find that change in this life is good. Sometimes change can ruin your life for awhile, but most of the time it turns out ok. People can learn a lot about themselves in times of change. You're learning a lot about yourself now.' Hopefully I will have lost their attention by using big words and long sentences, all the while conveying my true feelings about their haircut.    3. Have you ever found out something about a friend and then wished you hadn't? What happened?   Ok, I've been stuck on this question for like 20 mins now and I've got nothing. If something comes to mind, I'll post it latah.   4. If you could live in any fictional world (from a book/movie/game/etc.) which would it be and why?   Since I don't play video games, I'll go for a board game. I would like to live in Candyland. Why? Because everything is sweet and edible and the name rhymes with PANDYLAND! reason enough right there.   5.

Its an addiction I have, I need caffeine and NextBlog every morning to get me going.  I don't know how that button works, or how it selects which blog to go to next, but today there was a sort of theme woven into the melange of goodies.  I found one blog totally devoted to the daily doses of medication and inevitable deterioration of one woman's 14 year old cat, as it dies from some form or another of cancer.    Then there was  urlLink Not my dog , which didn't mention anything about a dog.  She has a cat though, that kept her up all night recently.  Anyone who's ever hated their cat due to an all night howling session can relate.  And finally,  urlLink Jason's Blog , which didn't mention any animals at all, but has a picture of a dog's tongue hanging out of a huge gaping dog mouth.  All made for some good reading today.

3581210,male,InvestmentBanking,"              Just so you know, this blog isn't about being political. If anything, it's about as apolitical as you can get for blogging. However, there is something that I wanted to comment on: you can use it to form your views or not. Oh, and I talk about some of the important points in here, so if you're going to see the movie bookmark this and read it later.    Last night I saw  urlLink Fahrenheit 9/11  (click for a  urlLink local review  and a trip to the  urlLink warroom ). It was a pretty good film. I had seen a few clips from it so I had an idea of what to expect, which was kind of unfortunate. Some said 'you'll laugh, you'll cry' and I think knowing that dampened the mood a bit. It may have been better if I didn't know what to expect (and, sorry, now you know kind of what to expect so I opened a bit of Pandora's Box for you too).   When getting the required popcorn and drinks (5,000 won, 4.50USD for a large tub and 2 drinks!) I was greeted by this guy (below). I had to say, 'That's quite a get-up you got there', knowing/hoping he wouldn't understand. At the door to the actual theatre a guy and a gal in the same costume did a little salute as everyone filed in. I didn't think about them again until the end of the movie.    urlLink      Soon he'll be wearing a different uniform.    Fahrenheit 9/11 was a pretty interesting show. It tweaked a few memories I had from that day. When it happened I was in bed in Vancouver, just waking up. As a stockbroker I was wired to the daily news and had turned on my T.V. at 5:50AM. The news of the first plane was already broken and I was thinking, 'What the heck? Some moron pilot slammed into one of the largest buildings in the world? Was it a terrorist?' When the second one hit I think we all knew that it was no accident.   I watched it all that morning. Waiting for the fires to be brought under control; or maybe for another plane to hit another tower. Who could tell what might happen? It was especially surreal for guys like me, I think (egotistical, eh?). My dream, as any guy in finance would have,&nbsp;was to&nbsp;be to be in Windows on the World (the posh restaurant at the top of one of the towers) giving a high-powered presentation to the money-men of New York and the world. That dream seemed more like a death sentence now. I don't know what the emotion was, but you might say I was relieved that I didn't go to Wharton or have a CEO dad who might get me into that room on that day. Of course you didn't have to be a financier to be there, many blue-collar people (firefighters and police) and 'regular Joes and Janes' were there as well.   The next day I went to work. It was quite odd. There was little to do and there was an eerie quiet as the sounds of the harbor-planes were absent. All I could think about was the day before. I still wonder why the heck they showed the towers getting hit and then crashing to Earth so many times in the weeks following. It sure didn't help my spirits.   Back to the movie. I knew what Michael Moore was up to when he made this film. His previous works included: Roger & Me (where he went looking for the CEO of GM (Roger Smith) for answers why his hometown of Flint, Michigan was laid waste by layoffs by the firm) and Bowling for Columbine (where he looked into the psychology of guns and violence that may have lead to the Columbine shootings). I saw a show or something with him as he went all over the country promoting his newest book and noting that the employees of the bookstores were basically getting shafted by their employers (part-timers with no benefits, low salaries, fired for small errors...hmmm sounds like Korea in some ways!). Now, I'm in finance, mostly of the idea that business is good, so even though I found the anecdotes he collected to be interesting and in some cases a little unsettling it didn't really change my thinking much. (I think most of us are pretty set in our ways unless we get overwhelming evidence over a long period of time.) I knew that Moore would be going after Bush, but I had no idea how much he had on him (or at least how bad he could make him look).   Moore's 9/11 was, as a documentary should be, presented as a well-researched, factual and intellectual piece. It went into the histories of the major participants (although not much on Saddam and I was worried about how he said that Iraq never hurt an American: some of it smelled of hyperbole) and presented the facts in logical sequence. Then he threw in a curveball. He had a gal in there (a wife and mother) who, in the beginning, loved the U.S. and the armed forces a lot. She carried her American flag out each day to hang on the front of her house--careful NEVER to let it touch the ground. Later, after her son died, she hated what had happened in her country. I'll tell you the worst part was how she was given the news--it was OVER THE PHONE! I remember in  urlLink We Were Soldiers  the Army sent the notices to the next of kin by taxicab (delivered by the drivers, no less) as there were so many dead they did not have enough officers to do the job. That, I thought was a low point, but this story plumbed the depths.   Clearly, Moore was not trying merely to make President Bush look bad (he made virtually&nbsp;everyone--Cheney, Rumsfeld, Rice--look unprofessional, but he could have done that to any of us who have been in front of the camera). He could have easily made the soldiers in Iraq look like unfeeling grunts bent on discharging their weapons at anything and anyone (which, it seems, they did do at times, but that was chalked up to the adrenaline rush of being in a hot zone). No, he went at things on a bit of a different tact. He personified not only the soldiers, but something more identifiable not only for Americans but for anyone who had a loved one in any country's armed services--he made a poster child of those who are left behind (temporarily or permanently) when a service member heads off on assignment in this mother who lost her son.   The mother (pictured below) is the real story and storyteller here. President Bush is a major figure, Moore is the one who brought it all together, but its her story that hits home more than any other. No 9/11 inquiry or senate committee can take away from her and her family's loss. Her husband said it best, though, when he said, 'We are very sad to lose our son in the war, but we are more sad to know that families all over America are having the same thing happen to them right now.' (I'm paraphrasing from my fallible memory, but I think you get the point.) It's the families that suffer(ed) when 800+ troops were killed in Iraq. (We also can't forget the loss of those in WTC, a disaster that was foreshadowed specifically in Presidential Briefings.)&nbsp; For some their will to support the President and perhaps America itself may have been broken. I thought of our popcorn-seller (above) and how his family would react if he were shipped of to war, trading one uniform for another. What if my son(s) were sent off without an imminent threat, as we had in WWII and other 'respected' wars? How could you be proud of a country that did that to its children?    urlLink      Who is the main character in Fahrenheit 9/11? President George W. Bush? Michael Moore? or the mother of a fallen soldier?    So, what is next? Will there be a sequel in a few years? Perhaps Fahrenheit 38 Degrees? (Meaning the parallel of latitude that splits North and South Korea, and translated to Celsius that's just 3.3 degrees--close to freezing, kind of a cold war, which is what we have here: a war, but no open hostilities.) I doubt, after all this, that Bush (or any U.S. President for the next while) has the political muscle to go after North Korea, and that's just fine by me. Heck, if anything happens Seoul is within range of the North's artillery (!), to say nothing of any missiles they may have that could get airborne (and if the U.S. says they don't have the capabilities I'm inclined now to think that maybe they do).   Some things are different in Korea. For one, the two Koreas are still, technically, at war. Only an armistice (or cessation of open combat) was signed, not a peace treaty. I read the North signed it but the U.S. declined to sign it--hearkening to Moore's idea that the military-industrial-political complex needs a 'constant state of high alert and confusion' to reach its aims (which are, mainly, focused on money).    I'm going to digress for a little bit here, sorry.  Much of what we know as culture can be traced back to war. For instance, the Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford that former President Bill Clinton received was founded by  urlLink Cecil Rhodes : one of the wealthiest and most powerful men of his time (so much so that the country of Zimbabwe's former name is Rhodesia, named after him). He made him money from exploitation of South African diamond mines--a country which was finally conquered by the Boer Dutch in 1902, the same year Rhodes died. As well, the respected  urlLink Nobel Prize  was founded by Alfred Nobel who made his money from a little product he invented: dynamite/T.N.T. A technological triumph that is best known as 'the thing that makes things blow up', as an explosives expert might put it.    Back to Korea.  Here there is really no question of whether the leaders are looking out for the people or themselves. A  urlLink recent article  reported that 74% of respondent to a survey of Koreans said they believe politicians are law-breakers. Maybe the same is true in the U.S., but 74% pretty much tells you that people here don't need a Michael Moore documentary to know what goes on behind closed doors. (I'm not sure if that is a good thing.)   The difference here, though, is the threat. As I said, there is still a war going on. South Korea has a mandatory term of military service for all male citizens with an  urlLink 18-month jail sentence  for those who do not comply (of course with a criminal record comes no chance of a job with the government or any larger company, so it's actually more of a life sentence). In the U.S. service is voluntary, it may be seem coerced given the salespitch of the recruiting officers, but it is, in the end, voluntary. Those who are in the service and do not want to be (re-)deployed to a place like Iraq are subject to court martial and possible imprisonment. Again, the difference here is North Korea has been saying for over 50 years that they are the real rulers of the Koreas and they will take back the South; while Iraq did not make (according to Moore, I'm not sure about this point) threats toward the U.S. North Korea also does not have any resources (something that can't make the economy in that non-trading country very viable).   Anyways, this is a record blog length for me, and I'm glad you came along for the ride. My last word is simply that after Moore's 9/11 movie I think many people, myself included, will start to ask more questions and make creating such wars (if I may go so far as that) harder to do in the future...and that, I imagine, was its intent.

I kind of miss the old times when I was still in Jakarta. Weekend seemed really fun. On Friday night I usually go out with friends.. kadang2 mencoba tempat2 baru..hehe . I remember when I was in high school, if we didn't have school on Saturday, we always went to new york cafe to watch the Groove on stage..hehe..they always knew our crowd, because we're all girls..hehe. On Saturday night we usually  'nonton midnite.'  And on Sunday, I usually go out for lunch or just to 'socially drink' coffee at the mall with my parents..hehe. Gosh, I miss home so much.  Last weekend (Fri-Sat) I had to go for a one night retreat. It was alright. I had fun, until I discovered that my room was full of bugs!! We finally moved to another room (which was nicer than the first one hehe), because we decided to not sleep with bugs flying around the room. What we did on the retreat was pretty much team building and playing games. The highlight of the retreat was when we got to do the drumming for diversity training. It was awesome..we could choose any kinds of instruments from drum to tambourine, and we just started playing them for more than two hours. We could all feel the energy that came out from the instruments. It was fun! The next day we all just felt exhausted and ready to go home. We stopped at dairy queen for ice cream on the way home..yumm!!   Hmm..what else..I got home two hours ago from eating out with puma and went to Walmart to buy some stuff. I didn't really wanna go at first because it's 'Nip/Tuck Show' day..hehe..but I went anyway and got home on time to watch the second show.   Hmm..I guess that's pretty much it. Tomorrow is another new day at work. How's your day people?            "

883178,male,Fashion,"           When I was in high school, I had the great good fortune to be among a group of 100 young men who participated in a mock government program in Washington D.C.  As part of our week in Washington, we laid a wreath at the tomb of the unknown soldier, and we saw one of those precision military rifle groups. The high point of the week was a visit to the White house where we met Reagan in the rose garden.  I spent the early part of the visit day waiting to see him so that I could pound him with difficult questions and prove that he was an empty suit.  'Mr. President, you claimed that ketchup is a vegetable...'  'Mr. President, you indicated that there is no homelessness in America, I wonder if you would accompany me...'  'As regards your Star Wars missle defense system, Mr. President...'  We got to the White House, made it through elaborate security, and waited for him in the rose garden where I had the best lemonade I have ever had in my entire life.  He finally came up, and I walked toward him to ask a question.  When I got there, he shook my hand, looked me in the eye with those piercing blues (by the way, he smelled great, and had the broadest shoulders I have yet seen) and started telling a story about young men and horses (I missed his point).  There are few men that I disagree with more than I disagreed with Reagan, but I have never met a more charismatic man in my entire life.  I walked in wanting to slay him with my rage, and, had he asked me, I would have campaigned for him that afternoon (within a few days, I reverted to form, but still).  I will never forget that meeting.   The new Modest Mouse CD 'Good News for People Who Like Bad News' is out.  It comes recommended to me by my friend Brian B., of Columbus, Ohio.  I have only given a few preliminary listens, and I will promise a full review later, but I can tell you, it has potential to be my album of the year.  A little Wilco, a little Flaming Lips, a little Frank Black.  I particularly admire track two:  'The World at Large.'  I went to Perkins for lunch.  I had a grilled cheese sandwich to go.  The good people at Perkins were kind enough to include a little cup of cole slaw.  It was great. I know there are some haters in the land, but for my money, cole slaw is the best possible presentation of cabbage.             "

3525620,male,Non-Profit,"       Opportunity, is it always present or is it once in a blue moon?  When is it best to go after opportunity and when is it not?  These are questions that I'm currently asking myself.  I believe I'm a natural born opportunist rooted in wisdom and realism.    The question that I'm asking is,  can it be wrong to pass on opportunity when you feel and believe it may not be the right time?   Actually, opportunity from what I've gathered is when luck and preparation meet.  I feel somewhat lucky that I was approved for a home loan for the price range that I wanted.  However, I just don't think I have everything in order.  For example, I need to increase my monthly income and reduce my current debt to feel comfortable enough to commit myself to a mortgage payment.  Then if I say no, I don't want to disappoint my family.  So what should I do?  Well opportunity should put you on the path of progression rather than regression.  The path that you choose to walk down will determine whether or not you'll pursue certain opportunities.  I am not a pessimist, but I'm just cautious and I like to operate within reality.  Reality dictates that if I commit to this mortgage, there really won't be any wiggle room or margin for error.  Also, we have a baby on the way and that in itself is going to increase our monthly expenditures.  I guess to summarize, my response is the same that I give when people ask me how did I know my wife was the one?   When you know, you just know.   The fact that you have doubts or unanswered questions, should be the red flags.  There's no philosophical explanation, no magic formula or anything.  When that opportunity is for you, a sense of confidence and peace enshrouds you.   The bottom line is that it's okay to say no to some opportunities, especially if it is not time or it was not intended for you.          "

4192173,male,Technology,"             Matt is obviously poopy from the lack of aggression in his life, so let me tell you about the Skinny Puppy shows. The fact of the matter is, as Irene put it, this was a 'reunion' show and no matter how much we loved this kind of stuff back in the day, and I was fortunate enough to see Puppy in 1992 (the best year ever), whatever we were about to see in 2004 just wasn't going to be the same thing. For some, like my significant other, this make the show skippable. For me, I can appreciate the challenge that was laying ahead for Mssrs. Key and Ogilvie.  Most of my interest in this was helped by the fact that the new album is really good. I respect their NOT going back and doing something they had done before (screw you diehards), so I expected them to do something different live. The quick comparison: Puppy was very performance art based in the old days, tons of props, big set, etc, which you could pull off back then without losing your shirt. in 2004, its impossible to pull off a big stage show, so the emphasis was focused on musical performance and to that effect, a guitarist/bassist was added as well as a drummer, while Mr. Key manned the keyboards. Honestly, I think that his moving from drums (he is amazing) to keyboards was perhaps the only true error of this tour. His style is unique and while I'm not knocking the drummer they had (he too was amazing), it did take away from their particular sound.  It seems I have spoken negative about this, but quite honestly, I had a blast, especially the first night. In an unusual move for me, I avoided reading about setlists, so I went into it all fresh. it was an open book for me. They played a great range of material spanning their whole career, including gems like GLASS HOUSES, TIN OMEN, TESTURE and INQUISITION, and other 'hits'. I was impressed by the way the music was presented and I thought the live versions, particularly of the olders stuff like SMOTHERED HOPE, were sharp without insulting the original versions. I would like to note that Ash marked out like a maniac at this gig, which is a big compliment. Also, we got TWO encores at this gig, which I'm told is very rare on this tour. By the time I left the first night, I was pumped to see it again.  The second night was interesting in that its like seeing a movie you really liked for the second time and you find things you like even more and now a few things you didnt like as much. But nothing I hated and I wasn't as excited as I was the first night, obviously, but it allowed me to appreciate the show more. I had heard from TODD RYAN (I spell his name in caps, so you can all yell at him), that Puppy had rehearsed 18 different set lists, but the set list was pretty much the same the second night. We stood in a different spot and got a better view than the night before, so it was fun to watch even more. Ogre's voice was much better the second night, and the music seemed tighter, but the crowd and the vibe was lacking the second night.   However, just when I was ready to get myself a drink, out of nowhere they brought out Grandpa Al to guest on TIN OMEN. It was 1992 (the best year ever) all over again. I don't think Al was plugged in, and he seemed quite zombified (and industrial Ozzy), but the idea of Al guesting with Puppy after all these years on a classic song he helped produce was enough for the crowd to lose their shit and for the 19 year old in me to flash a wide smile. It may not have been a classic performance, but it was certainly a classic moment. And in this day and age, a classic moment here and there with our old heroes is good enough...even if they look like theyre straight out of WEEKEND AT BERNIES.  F               "

Anyone in 3.16 would know that the maths dean can be one hell of a bitch. Oh yes... Did I mention that she was a close friend of my mother's? Well I was relieved when my maths teacher told me I was 'almost' called up, which meant that I wasn't called up. But what happened was even worst. The Maths Dean made a personal call to my mom, telling her to 'keep a closer eye on him.' Oh... And you know what she told my mom? 'He was involved in a copying case.' Wow! That's specific enough... My mom actually thought I copied in my maths test, cause I was struggling with a question the day before. And I'll bet she'll get suspiscious should my results come out perfect. &nbsp; What a bitch... I really should get my maths teacher to clear this matter up. Call my mom then...

3022585,female,Education,"       I’ve realized it is real work being a girl.  The maintenance is insane and usually I am not great at making regular appointments for the filing and plucking and cutting and tweezing and polishing.  I usually get things done on a whim or because I can’t take the jungle growing above my eyes anymore.  Home upkeep is far cheaper, but I am far from skilled enough to keep it up.  I try for a few weeks and then I have to revert to the professionals.   I’ve never really been the kind to have one hairdresser that I go to excusively.  A college roommate would travel 45 minutes back home to get her hair done and still goes to the same lady today though now the commute is about an hour or more.  I don’t understand that.  Sure, a good hairstylist is hard to find, but there are several out there, in every city.    I’ve never had a fear of the haircuts either.  I’ve walked into salons for the first time and told the stylist to just do whatever they wanted to do.  Some stylists like this, others, not so much.  I haven’t really ever had a bad experience.  One hairdresser said that I didn’t have to worry about my hair framing my face while other women used their hair to enhance their features and thus the anxiety they have.  I think she was complimenting me.  She also gave me one of the best haircuts and I ended up going back to her a few times.  In the 10 months that I've lived in Richmond I've had my hair cut three times by three different people, none were bad, but none were exceptional either.  Today, my stylist was Daniel, a thin man with spiked dirty blond hair who smelled like cigarettes and herbal shampoo.  I was apprehensive at first for a man to be plucking my eyebrows and cutting my hair and then he spoke and walked.  There is something comforting about a gay man being in charge of your beauty needs.  I told him I just needed a trim and he guided me to a sink then said we’d do the eyebrows first so we went to back room with a comfy bedlike chair.  He worked on my eyebrows longer than most women stylists have.  He plucked the small thin straggling hairs at the top corners of my brows and only put the wax on once.  He massaged the areas wear he had waxed and plucked.  He relaxed me.  He took his time and care.     I was disappointed that he didn’t massage my head when he shampooed my hair.  I expected he was an extended massager, he wasn’t.  As we walked to his styling chair I wanted to tell him to do whatever he wanted with my hair, to put his spin on it.  As he was combing out I my hair, I wanted to tell him to be creative, do what he thought was best for my face.  I never did.  I sat quietly and watched the other customers.  He never asked how much I wanted taken off.  He just took my hair and started cutting.  He cut it to a healthy length, parted it down the middle and added subtle layers.  He did this without asking or telling me.  He cut and cut and cut, the layers taking time and many head tilts.    When he was finished cutting he put straightening cream and hair gel into my wet hair and blew it dry using a rolled brush to straighten and turn the ends under, a skill I can never get down.  He didn’t talk much, nor did I, but when he did he said things like “rock and roll” and “twisted.”  With these words, I realized we couldn’t be friends.    Hours after meeting him, he lingers.  When my hair swishes or I brush it out of my face, I smell him, cigarettes and herbs.  In the time that I walked in looking for a simple trim and walked out with a hairstyle, Daniel became my hairdresser.  I’m committing to him like no other man.  I know at least he will take his time and care and he'll give me what I need without even asking.          "

589736,male,Technology,"           If we don't have anything the fire ants want, they go away.  Eliminate the reason.  If we want to get our Retaliation Jones on, eliminate the reason while simultaneously taking out a few nests.  But if we don't eliminate the reason, we have to exterminate all fire ants, everywhere, for all time, faster than they can respond.    Another argument that has been added to the original one:  terrorists act out of hatred of liberty.  For crying out loud.  They act out because they want something to change, somewhere.  We may agree or disagree with that thing they want changed, and we can certainly be angry about their method, but don't avoid the issue by saying they're just mean people.  There is such a thing as kleptomania, and I can imagine a thrill in the act, but in general people steal things because they want them.  All the alarms and police in the world won't stop thieves until everyone has what they want.  Of course, meeting everyone's material desires is impossible.  But we can *combine* deterrents (police, locks, alarms) with strategies that target the cause:  we can educate people in how to get jobs, and show them the rewards of individual work -- both in material wealth and individual pride.  Our country does fairly well with this; I feel confident there is less stealing here than in, say, poor South American cities where there is a lot of law enforcement (though corrupt), no path to education and no honor in a hard day's work or in providing for a family.  My point being, arguing that people steal because they want things, can lead to nearly comprehensive solutions.  But arguing that people steal because they're evil -- what could that approach possibly solve?  Terrorists hate America not because they hate liberty -- I'm sure some of the 9/11 hijackers enjoyed a few shopping malls on the sly -- but because of clear (to them) wrongs that have been committed.  Ignore their reasons in the response, and they keep on coming.  Paint over those reasons with a gloss of 'They hate liberty!  They hate freedom!', and Joe Dimwit Public will happily welcome black+white villains he can zap with his ray gun.  See, the argument has kept roaming farther and farther afield of critical thinking.  Instead of smoking out terrorists, sometimes by force, we're told that we're attacking evil people who hate liberty and freedom.  I still feel there's a strong argument to be made for war -- but somewhere it got lost when we all started wrapping ourselves in the flag and the righteous justice of Almighty God.  P.S.

3416559,female,Internet,"                 I'm blogging today because it says in my planner that today I blog.  I'm using a Franklin Covey Planner, Daily Classic size with the New Yorker Pages. Those are cool pages they have a mono-tone blue border with the New Yorker font (you'd know it if you saw it.) Everyday it gives a little cartoon - the cartoons have long been the most brilliant part of the magazine - and a funny little news item. The New Yorker has a name for these spots ... I forget it though. Andy White use to write them. That part I remember.  Franklin Covey markets their planners as tools to help focus on the important part of life. The Franklin in their name refers to Ben, who kept a little diary where he outlined his goals and plans.  It's not so much a journal or a calander, although it's that too. The point is that you use their tools to help focus on what you want to accomplish. They have a series of guides that lead to your writing a mission statement for your life. Then the daily and monthly planners help you keep those goals in focus while getting you through the daily chores of meetings and work and assignments and so on.  Personally, suffering as I do from severe depression, I find myself feeling overwhelmed by tasks so I procrastinate and think of it as 'too much.' The more you procrastinate, of course, the more there is to be done and the greater the mental burden.  So I've been using my Franklin as a way to keep track - I outline what I want to accomplish step-by-step and I can look and see for myself that I don't have to do EVERYTHING RIGHT NOW. My planner today says I need to pray, blog and schedule out next week. I've also chosen to clean my room and shower. (Believe me, for a person with depression this is like swimming the English channel, some days.)  Instead of feeling overwhelmed, I feel proud that I accomplished today's goals and confident that I can accomplish tomorrow's. It's a major turn-around in my mental process.

I took the oppratunity to go to lunch with my Mom since I was in the East Bay anyways and it's been a while since I've gone to lunch with her. I then went to Cody's Books in Berkeley and looked at (Surprise!) some books. I bought one. For the purpose of suspence I will not reveal what the book that I bought was untill a later date.   I went home, played some video games, and took a long nap. That nap ended up screwing me in the end.

883178,male,Fashion,"            Here's the Skinny   As a couple of you know, I never received a letter from the BU.  So I thought I'd send him a Dear John letter, telling him, basically, we're through.  I sent it (via e-mail, no screwing around here) yesterday.  He responded with a heartfelt note saying how he was so sorry for his recent behavior and how I was still special to him, and he knows he has trouble expressing his emotions, yadda, yadda, yadda.  I thought what he said was all very nice, and at one point I actually thought to myself 'maybe I've been too hard on him'.  But then at the end of his little note he asked if he could call me on Sunday.  I responded with something like: 'Sure, call me, but why wait until Sunday?'  'Because I'm busy every night until then.'  Oh, I see.  'Don't you see I'm STILL not a priority to you?'  'I can try calling you tonight...'  To which I responded (as an ode to DJS, these are my exact words, no lie): 'Can't.  Busy.'  Finally, I just picked up the phone because I thought 'How dumb is it that we're having this lame convo via e-mail.'  PB: What is it that you have to say to me? BU:  I wanted to see how you were doing.  PB: Ah, isn't that  apparent ??  So what you're saying is, you want to call me so  you  feel better?  Hmmm, selfish again. BU:  I'm not meaning to be selfish.  PB: No, BU, you never have.  How very sad.

Arn't guys the cause for everything? I'd say so. And one thing about guys is...they never EVER know the right things to say.  Today has been well crap. I have spent most of my day pondering, moaping, crying over Tom. Well not really crying, just a few tears. The fact is he will never know how much i love him, and how i would do anything for him. The truth is he just doesnt care. Well why should he? I have a boyfriend now. The fact is i will never be able to get over him. I could never love anyone like him. Of course i cant exactly tell him that. I try but i think he gets a little freaked out. Which is understandable. I'm like pouring my heart out to him. I wonder if he ever loved me. That's something that is always gonna play on my mind.  I don't really talk to him anymore. I always want to, but i dont cos i know how it will upset me, what with him being in England, and me now in f'in canada. Aww it's like one of those tradgic love novels you read. Heh. Well kinda... Anyway back to my point. He starts a conversation with me every now and again. It starts off fine then memories come back. Gahh i hate them. I think the worst thing for me though is seeing how much he has changed. I told him i will never love anyone as much as him. Yeh great move kelly he's already not good at commitment. But well i can't have commitment with him anyway. *sulks* he called our love 'Puppy love'. What the hell is puppy love? I don't want puppy love.  The other problem is AJ. I am realising how much i love him also more and more. I don't want to be in love with two guys!? AJ is so good to me, and im happy, but its the simple fact i will never be able to get over Tom. End of story.  Wow glad i could get that out. I wrote a popem whilst waiting for my damn sister to get off the comp so i could start this. I desperatley needed to pour it out!  Love is a strong word i wish i never had to say, giving my heart away day after day.  Love is a strong word but i said it to you, knowing how i felt, so deep and so true.  Love is a strong word, you once said to me, little did i know it wasn't meant to be.  Love is a strong word, and now i take it back, burn it with my memories and tears i held back.  DramaQu33n.

766556,female,indUnk,"        Rizzn's fault  I checked  urlLink rizzn's page , and his protest on another blog's comments on the whole gay marriage thing got me thinking (damn him).  I heard a comment on NPR last night, where Bush said something about history proving that marriage between a man and woman is best (or something like that).  I tried to find the quote online today, to be all professional and correct and stuff, but I figured I'd just forge on ahead without it.  Everytime I hear that man speak, I think to myself, 'What the hell is he thinking?'  On the surface, he seems to share the same ideas, thoughts and beliefs of the common 'good american'.  You know, the right wing, republican, christian upbringing, tons on money in the bank common american.  Unfortunately, I don't think he goes any deeper than the surface.  I also don't think he goes any further than the imaginary borders of this country.    I wonder what impact these 4 years will have on the next 20, the next 50, the next 200.  In my great grandchildren's history books, will he be a Truman, or a Nixon?  Will there be another 4 years of him?  Does he ever wonder this too?  His actions and thoughts impact everyone, presently and years into the future.  With any luck, the issues brought forward in his presidency - family, health, money, religion, war - will inspire future leaders to move ahead with less personal agendas.  It is good to talk about what he has brought into the limelight.  It is good to debate over what works and doesn't work.    The critical thinking being done now about so many issues will, in the end, have some impact on how we think, act, plan, marry, spend, work, live.

4192173,male,Technology,"             The Factor Corporation gathered it's division heads at the cage last night. The Head of Engineering decided to show an hour and a half late, which gave yours truly, the CEO, the opportunity to have a nice drink at Les Halles downtown with Deputy Douche. Later we were joined by General Rabinowitz and I gave them a sneak preview of the new Chemlab, which they liked and appreciated. A good test.  Anyway, once we all got up to speed on where all the songs are at, we went back to those earlier acoustic tracks the four of us recorded some time ago. They hadn't been addressed since the initial recording. Well, one of them, which we just call TWO BASSES (obviously wont be the final title) has now morphed into a really cool trip hop track that suddenly goes dance. VERY cool loops from Ash and then Robin and I recorded some additional guitars and bass, respetively. B wrote some new stuff as well that he will be recording in the coming days. Suddenly this track has a whole new life and a new vibe that I am very into.  We then addressed THEYVE JUST, which will remain a sparse, acoustic based track (I think). Robin went mental (for Robin) and was pissed a certain take of her guitars wasn't used. I think she hit Ash at one point, even though this is really something I did. Anyway, we found the part and will be putting it in. I promise, Robin! I think Brandt has a track or two to add to this one and then I will take another pass at it. Very moody piece, very romantic and fits real well on the album.  Lastly, we tackled SOLAR, which we all have problems with. Everyone has pin pointed that the problem lies in verses, which are not as full developed as the choruses. People were a little hesitant to make comments cause I had done the arrangement, but I was fully in agreement with the comments made and am determined to get this song up to speed. Brandt had some guitar lines that I think I totally missed that will work on improving the verses. This weekend, the idea will be for me to write an entirely new bass line and get some sax in there. I see this as the album closer. The song is there, we just need to develop more.  A lovely trip back to the Gramercy area with Robin, the ass grabber. She expressed to me how much she she enjoys working with HF, but also misses the aggression. As Batman used to say in the old TV series: 'Poor Deluded Child'.

3022585,female,Education,"       I was strolling through B&N one day and noticed that in the SAT prep section there were new materials, which were not part of my SAT study path.  I had a tinge of jealousy seeing 'SAT word' novels on the shelf.  The titles like BUSTED and HEAD OVER HEELS accompanied cheesy cover art and promised stories of love and mystery among high school students.  These 'novels' are written around common vocab. words found on the SAT and those words even appear in bold type within the text.  I was jealous because even though I have a BA in English Lang. and Lit. and love to read, I hated and struggled with reading throughout elementary, middle and high school.    My majoring in English was a surprise even to myself because I entered college loathing reading and writing.  I even went to the writing center on campus to get assistance with my early college papers and I would come out knowing I had much work ahead of me.  I was originally going to major in Psychology thinking that I needed this background for teaching.  But, my heart was never in Psychology and when one of the best professors I ever had gave me a C, it pushed me to make a change.    He was one of the best professors, not because of his teaching, but because of our talks during my office visits.  I went to him often for help because I was failing his class.  He became my friend and gave me guidance.  I learned about his family and his struggles in college and he helped me see that my world was not, in fact, collapsing around me.  We didn't talk much about the class I was taking from him, these were more like therapy sessions.  The strange thing about his role in my life that semester (and even later when I would go and visit with him) is that his specialty was in learning and cognition and he worked primarily with mice.  He wasn't trained for the sessions we had and when he handed me chemwipes as I cried during my first visit, I knew he would be my friend.    After a few sessions in his office, the semester was ending and it was time for the final exam.  I rocked the socks off of my final, but he still gave me a C for the course, I was one point away from a B- and passing the class.  I was heartbroken and felt betrayed. When I went to see him after winter break to discuss my grade, he didn't flinch although he had previously and quietly said he would help me if I made a good enough grade on the final.  I left his office quietly and quickly that day, there was no therapy session to work me through this one and I wasn't that upset, surprisingly.  He knew what he was doing; he knew my heart was not in Psychology.  With the threat of having to retake that Psychology class to finish the major looming in the distance, I went on with my other classes.  While studying THE EPIC OF GILAMESH for an anthropology class with a friend, I realized I had to change my major.  I loved the analysis of psychology, but I hated the science of it.  English, this is where I could find the analysis I craved without any science to confuse my brain.  I crammed every English class available into my schedule.  I stuck to mostly poetry classes as I thought this was my passion.  I think part of me really liked how short poems where.  I was still a little afraid of all that reading.  But, I couldn't avoid it forever and I'm so glad that I had to read books like A RAISIN IN THE SUN, AS I LAY DYING, DROWN, NATIVE SON, CYMBELINE, THE COLOR PURPLE, and THE BLUEST EYE.    I wasn't the best at reading all the assigned readings.  'Sir Gawain' and Chaucer didn't excite me and there were Colonial American passages that put me to sleep, literally.  I still struggle with my love/ hate relationship with reading.  I wish I were voracious at it.  I think it's partly that it takes time for stories to unfold.  I wish I could finish books in one sitting like a movie, but I read slowly.  I read every word and say each one silently in my head.  I know there are speed-reading methods, but I don't want to skip over words, I just wish I could read every word, faster.    A few years ago, I started a book journal where I write character maps and synopses of the books I read.  It's an idea from my 10th grade English teacher and I find it good for me.  I have physical proof that I've read a book and it jogs my memory if I can't remember a plot line or character details.  In the beginning of the journal I noted words I needed to look up, big words not in my daily vocab.  This lasted for about 3 books (OK just 1 really) and then the words I didn't know disappeared from the entries as if I've mastered the English Lang.  Hardly, I just got lazy, realizing I probably would never use or see those big words again and just began to skim over them.  But, sometimes, I crave bigger words in my head and I wonder if I read 'SAT vocab.' novels, would I cognize the context clues, ascertain the definitions and ameliorate my conversations?

Now my Microsoft Word application won't open, and certain folders in the Finder can't be opened either.    And I have 3 MAJOR essays due soon.    HELP!! I'm almost in tears. This is terrible. And I really wanted to finish an essay by today so I could start on the rest. But I guess it's not meant to be. The scary thing is, I think I may have to send it into the Apple Store and get it fixed, and they might wanna change the hard drive or something. Which means I'll have to backup all my applications etc. and I don't have a CD writer or anything (although I could back it up on iDisk on the Apple servers, but that'll take too long on my 56k modem). I think hopefully my *AHEM* good buddy Charles (nudge nudge) might lend me his external CD-writer so I can back up my stuff.       WHY MUST THIS HAPPEN NOW??      I'm sure there must be a reason for all this to happen, some sort of Big Master Plan or something.  Either that or I should just be less  lun-zun .   Personally, I think it's the latter. Not that I don't believe in a BMP, just that I'm always  lun-zun  ;-)  Charles and E-Gene tell me that all the time. Like how if I could just be more aware, and watch what I'm doing I could avoid lotsa accidents.   But the point is, it's not like I'm not trying or anything. When you're unconsciously unaware, you just ARE. It's not like you can really help it.   Or Can You??    I don't know. I really don't know.

4192173,male,Technology,"             Taking the streak even further, I cruised into the studio on Sunday to check on progress there. I played my new arrangements and received an enthusiastic thumbs up for the first four songs. B then played me some new guitar parts for a rocker called 'Clean Up' (this is NOT the final title, I'm just sick of typing 'the one where I play bass here and he plays guitar here', know what I mean?). I was dead into these guitars and demanded I'd be given the parts immediately to go arrange this tune. B complied and when trasnferring the songs from laptop to laptop, my powerbook takes ANOTHER DIVE!!!!!  Angry beyond belief, I dropped everything and ran to Apple. Got soaked in the rain as well. So I get to Apple and lo and behold all I did was hit one wrong button and everything was fine. But man was I pissed. But man was I happy to learn nothing was messed up and I was able to go spend a nice evening with S.O. and the nice people who raised me.  We have the agent/lawyer/advisor staying with us, but while she is off doing legal things and S.O. is working, I was able to arrange 'Clean Up' and E it over to the studio, where B sang its praises. He would tell me if it was crap, so I am quite pleased.  Note that Hypefactor.com is now running with news and the 'Making Of The Distracted Lover'. Worthy reads. Pictures soon I think. I gotta get this beard on film, you know.  Ash and I talk via IM yesterday. He was messaging me from an airport in Florida, where he was able to wirelessly connect. How I don't know, cause i don't think it was via his cel phone. I am kinda scared of how he did that, yet I am impressed and ponder all the time I could save at LAX and Newark with that ability. Ash is into the HF2 material and we plot some new ideas based on things I have discussed previously with him and B. MP3's are exchanged for inspiration and reference. I am still scared of his ability to connect to the net in the airport...  I will try to maybe get to one more song today, if I feel it, and we might gather The HF Corp. this week to review what we have at this point and maybe work on new stuff.  Chemlab is being mastered this week by Dave Suycott of Machines of Loving Grace and Stabbing Westward. He's got some good ears on him, so I am confident the final product will sound massive. The label has the artwork and hopefully this will be in production quite soon. I can't wait to hear the final mixes! I'm sure you can't either...it's worth the wait!  F          "

And I don't have to because it's our site and we can do whatever the hell we want... Bono (for his music, sex appeal, charity work, and for pissing off DJS) Kate Hudson (could she be any cuter?...plus, she's the poster child for flat women everywhere.) J. Lo (not so much cuz I like her, but because she always gives us crap to talk about) Claire Danes (she's been in some great indy films and was in the best show on TV - My So-Called Life) Vince Vaughn (love the funny, smartass attitude.  Ms. T partied with him in LA and said he was even cooler in person)   2. Who is your least favorite?  Saddam Hussein (for obvious reasons) Renee Zellweger (I have no idea what the fascination is) Britney Spears (that carnie-looking wanna-be virgin freak) Jennifer Aniston (she always looks like she's constipated) Any Super Model (eat already) Andie MacDowell (worst actress ever.  stop your whining.) Mariah Carey (no-talent slut) Katie Couric (hiding behind that crazy smile is a cuckoo liberal bitch)   3. Have you ever met or seen any celebrities in real life?   Never met, just seen.  I saw Sarah Jessica Parker while I was shopping in the village.  Queen Latifah when I was dining with Thong (v. embarrassing).  The guy from the B-52's while walking through Soho (don't even know his name).  Rosie Perez was in front of me in line at the friends-and-family sale at J Crew on 5th Ave.  For the record, she was not looking good without make-up...and she bought about $400 worth of clothes.  Wait, one more...I saw Elizabeth Hurley in Marshall Fields on State St here in Chi.   4. Would you want to be famous? Why or why not?    I think it would be a blast.  I'm a sucker for some good drama, so why not get the paparazzi involved?  I'd invite them shopping with me.   5. If you had to trade places with a celebrity for a day, who would you choose and why?  I picked J Lo before, but maybe this time I would choose Madonna.  That would be one wacky day.          "

3581210,male,InvestmentBanking,"             As readers will know, my favorite airline is Singapore Air (SAI).  They have those personal monitors for everyone with on-demand movies, TV shows and games..and some lovely-looking stewardesses, of course.  Another thing going for them is their empathy with their passengers.  I've twice been bumped up to business class (with it's better meals and basically flat sleeper beds...what an experience that is).  Once because the travel agent made a mistake and SAI decided they'd make my life a bit easier (hint: if you take the same flight 5-10 times they get to know you, too) and another time my flight was overbooked so I too business to San Francisco and got another one to Vancouver (both covered by SAI) as well as 500 Sing$ (300 USD, 350,000 won) which made for a 40% discount from my ticket price.  Anyways, this time I was in line for about 30 minutes (maybe it was longer) and a few times I squatted to relieve my legs a bit.  The gal at the counter apologized and put 2 'Solitaire' tags on my bags (will upload pic when I get back to Seoul so you can put your color printer to good use and make a few of your own) that basically put them on par with business class for unloading.  Nice.  The meals on the flight were good, there were lots of good movies and, as usual, they gave me one of those sleeper masks when I asked for it (in business it's automatic, but if you ask in economy you'll get one).  Upon arrival in Vancouver I saw a rare sight, the customs area was packed!  A cruise was in port and normal flights all bunched up to.  Not to worry, though, as just as I approached the line they opened another area of inspectors...and in about 10 minutes I was picking up my bags.  To top it off my cabbie spoke English (something that eluded me in Seoul and Vancouver much of the time) and we had a pretty cool conversation about life, marriage and cultures.  (He too believes that once you stop looking for a spouse you'll meet them...a little wisdom for you single-but-lookings out there.)  My phone can take pictures here but needs a special chip to connect.  I forgot its charger and extra battery, and already ran down the old one...so that's the only blotch on this trip so far; which ain't too bad.

3305309,male,indUnk,"           It’s 11:15 in the morning, and my stomach and head are at war. It’s Day One of Phase One of the South Beach Diet revisited, which means I’m on a strict, imbibe-no-crap regimen. It’s also the day we take my co-worker to lunch for her birthday. The Birthday Lunch is a ritual that began when people lived in caves. You can see it on the walls at Lascaux – the piercing eyes of stick figure cavemen imploring, asking the birthday caveman how his mastodon tastes. He responds with a tentative grunt, self-conscious, polite. They make small talk and navigate uncomfortable pauses by taking keen interest in their food. Later, there’s cake.   Apparently, we have not progressed. The co-worker assigned to round up the troops lets us know the Birthday Lady has decided on Olive Garden.   Olive Garden.   Olive Garden, where I can eat exactly one thing on the menu, the Chicken Caesar Salad, and watch the rest of my table feed on sumptuous-smelling breadsticks. Olive Garden, where they serve you salad family style before bringing your meal, which means I will eat redundantly, salad followed by salad. Olive Garden, where the A/C is cranked to nipple-hardening, lip-numbing temperatures, where they bring you full glasses of iced tea rather than just fill your half-filled glass, leading you to feel a contractual obligation to drink more tea, where you are indeed a pawn in some waiter’s kill-the-lunchtime-boredom game of Customer Iced Tea Drinking Races, where the waiter will mention I look tired at lunch when, really, I look ripped-off and petulant, the result of being dragged, not exactly against my will but not exactly out of instinctual, let’s-eat-there impulse, to Olive Garden.  They seat seven of us at a ten-top and won’t seat us at the eight-top the next table over because that’s the “training section.” This means we are assuredly in the hands of professionals. Our professional waiter saunters over, suggestive-sells us drinks (we decline), suggestive-sells us appetizers (we decline), and hands us menus, thinking us cheap and unfestive, which is not altogether inaccurate.   I look at the menu, scan the items, confirming the worst. Carboload. Carbomax. Carblicious. Carbohydrate Surprise. Carb To My Lou. Carbeteria. Chicken Caesar Salad. Defeatedly, I place my order, and settle into a randomly-firing conversation about negligent boyfriends, mundane vacation spots, and death.  No matter how witty your co-workers, no matter how much lemon butter is drizzled over the main course chicken, no matter how quick and efficient your waiter, Birthday Lunch is the Hindenburg of lunch dates. If you live in an office with politics, they will edge the bare spots in conversation and poke through like weeds to sidewalks. If you cannot speak frankly and openly under the flourescent lights of your office, you are doomed to fail under the non-descript light of a chain restaurant.   Tempers will flare. Envy will lick its lips and look for a hand mirror. Ennui will take a silent roll through the gates in a giant wooden horse. Birthday Lunch will make you pine for other discomforting engagements, like College Reunion Karaoke Night, or Acquaintance Strip Club Bachelor Party, or Obscure Relative Closed-Casket Funeral.   And then, later, there’s cake.  If you are dieting, cake means watching other people eat cake. It means singing-in-public punishment and then declining cake reward. It means wearing a forced smile and drinking from a comically-oversized glass of water in a valiant effort to feel full, compliments on your willpower, tsk-tsk chiding from those who can’t resist pointing out, “You don’t know what you’re missing,” when, in fact, you do. It means 15 minutes of conversation with the entire office as difficult to predict as roulette. Could be boredom, could be agitation, could be earnestly funny and the highlight of the work day, could be harrowing cryptic precursor to layoffs and reassignments and general work-related doom.   At the point in the proceedings you wish your parents were there, so you could ask to be excused from the table, you may beg off and return your cubicle and let your email and your homepage of choice and your personalized screensaver soothe you back into the space that is no longer shared, to the refreshing consolation that though no man is an island, sometimes, you get to be relatively close to an island – perhaps, an isthmus.  And, if you are like me, you know that sometime in the next 364 days, the discomfort of the Birthday Lunch will be on your behalf. And if you are like me, you can’t predict the level of angst or boredom or restless fuss that will tether itself to your day. But you will know, at least, that you will have your pick of restaurants, and one guess as to where you won’t be dragging the rest of the office.           "
4192173,male,Technology,"             As of 5 p.m. today - Saturday - there are enough guitars on 'Solar' to injure a small animal. So much for minimal.  Honestly, though, I could not help myself. The track captured my imagination right off that bat in a way that few do. It has a slow, funky shuffle - ' urlLink When The Levee Breaks ' meets ' urlLink A Northern Soul '-era Verve - that lends itself to all kinds of psychadelic jamming. I layered echo-drenched 12-string parts, harmonized e-bows, wah-wah'ed funk lines. Had I the time or money for  urlLink draw , this would be the track to which I would smoke.  I even added an extended track of  urlLink theremin , which previously made an appearance on the ' urlLink Theme From J-Bar .'  Now poor F.J.'s job is to sort out the twentysomething tracks of instrumentation. My realistic expectation is that half of what I recorded will be wildly altered or removed altogether, but that is OK. While I enjoy jamming and layering parts on these songs, ultimately everyone on this record subscribes to a 'song first' mentality. In other words, if the part does not work for the song, it goes. Plain and simple.  This working method also happens to be F.J.'s strong point as an arranger. I have never known him to discard a part that helped a song, and at this point in our long working relationship, I have the utmost trust in his discriminating ear. If something gets cut, it happens for a reason.  The process of arranging and cutting is also eased by the fact that there is little to no ego about individual parts among the members of this project. In all my time working on hypefactor, I have never known someone to piss and moan about  their  part being cut from a song. Well, there was that one time that all of F.J.'s bass parts were removed, and he went on a bender that ended with him capsizing his sailboat during the  urlLink Fastnet  race. But that's another story altogether...  Speaking of guitar parts, on Thursday night Ash played some sweet parts on a  urlLink Gibson ES-330  in between bouts of programming. His playing really stands out, and he clearly has an instinctive ear for a good hook. Like me and  urlLink Johnny Marr , Ash takes many of his cues from  urlLink The Cure's Robert Smith , a fine guitarist who has never quite received his due as a player from  urlLink the rock elite . Perhaps it was the  urlLink hair ?         "

883178,male,Fashion,"            It  Is  Discrimination (with a stunning surprise ending)  By Duf Fer  I have been meaning to respond to your post from a few days ago, Panda, and have not found time to type my thoughts (what with the Jackie Brown imbroglio and all).  Anyway, I wanted to say that it  is  discrimination in the workplace when you treat someone differently because of their marital/parental status.  I was talking to Hal about it, and these are my thoughts:  Being married (in and of itself) should not make a difference in how people are treated at work.  However, I feel I am treated differently (better) at work because I am married.  I think people take married folks more seriously, and I think our society tends to root for families (read married people).    People with kids are torn.  You usually have to leave by a set time (I get away with it because Mrs. Duf is extraordinarily supportive and has a job where she is done every day at the same time) and be with your youngins.  Heres whats different.  Everyone knows you have a child, and everyone knows it means that sometimes you will not be able to stay late or take that trip.  I should note that there is an expectation that fathers will have work as a slightly higher priority than home and will still go the extra mile.  The bread-winner expectation is still there.  I feel it a lot a work (a lot of folks I work with are childless  we have an amazingly, disproportionately high number of DINKs here).  When I take a half day because my daughter is sick, I don't expect anyone to take up my slack, but I do feel that some folks wonder why Mrs. Duf isn't doing it instead of me.  Single people without kids have a tougher time because people at work tend to assume that they have nothing else to do except burn the midnight oil.  That is a yucky assumption.   When I read your piece Panda, I was thinking about my situation at work.  There are two people who have my job title.  Me (married for 3 years with 1 child) and my counterpart (married for 25 years, 2 kids are grown and out of the house).  The easy assumption is that my counterpart can come in whenever she wants and leave whenever she wants.  I stroll in around nine (hey, Hal set the standard) and people know it is because I have to get my daughter up and dressed and to daycare (much more time consuming than you would think  I wake everyday at 6:00 and I cant get to work until 9:00 when all is said and done).  But her life is still full of obligations.  She moved to a new house, she broke her foot, and she has a sister up north in the middle of an awesome battle against cancer.  My whole point:  we need to move to place where we dont consider marital status (or parental status) in the workplace.  We should not assume that because someone is single and childless that work is the only thing that have to do.     Surprise ending:  Panda and I are in AGREEMENT!           "

I mean, they didn't support this thing in the first place, by them helping us now, isn't it sort of positive feedback (along the lines of, 'Well, we don't approve, but here's the cookie anyways, now run along and go invade some other country').  At least, that's how I see it.  By providing assistance in the form of funds and manpower, they have freed up OUR troops to go off and do OUR Presidents bidding.

4192173,male,Technology,"             Took a brief pit stop into the studio last night for a few hours to fix up Solar. Some parts previously laid down needed to be re-recorded to fit in the song properly. When arranging, this happens. So of course a simple piano part now is three tracks of three different ideas that I will sort through today. Once this minor tweaking is done, I'll E it over to the studio, where B will prep it as am MP3 for the 'Corporation' (as I call it) to hear. I have a good vibe about this song.  We had the Latin Grammy's on, hoping to get a glipmse of Cerati, who I have a feeling didn't bother to show, despite being nominated for Best Rock Album (I think).  Meanwhile, Brandt presented some parts for the new song he mentioned earlier here in the blog blog blog. Despite it's Thrill Kill Kult rip off strings that might need tweaking, I quite liked and laid down a quick bassline. I struggled for a bit to come up with more and decided not to push it and wait till B lays down all his guitars. His parts for this are good and I'm looking forward to playing with this one.   The new Twilight Singers EP arrived the other and day and all I can say is: Greg BY GOD Dulli, you have been sorely missed. Welcome back!

After bringing up my problem to several front desk staff members and to a few managers, I finally clawed my way to the top - the GM of the Marriott Courtyard Midtown East - basically the CEO of the hotel.  I explained what had happened and expressed my fear as a 'single woman alone in [her] hotel room...'  I also used my 'preferred customer status' at Marriott chains (I'm a silver member, the lowest of statuses, but status just the same).  I reminded him that I spend thousands of dollars at his hotel, and because of this 'incident' I may be forced to not book here again.  'Ms. Panda, we are at your mercy. [No lie - those were his exact words.]  What can we do for you?  A free breakfast, perhaps?'  I went for the gold.  'I want a free night.'  An hour later, the GM met me in the lobby.  'I have comped all charges from last night.'  Score one for the single lady.  I got a $250/night room for free.           "

We had a really tough time finding a good spot.  Fianlly though, we found a place in the 6th row from the stage.  We could actually see the features on their faces!  It was truly great.  Almost everyone there was really preppy, the sort who obviously has a lot of money.  Hell, with a lot of those people, their parents probably paid for it.  I'm completely in debt to my parents.  I'll be doing a lot of babysitting and ironing for this concert.  But man, ws it worth it.  Adam Levine is sooooooooo hot, and Maroon 5 KICKED ASS.  Of course, I knew all the words to all the songs.  My god, I listen to that cd enough.  at least once a day... since june 1st... 2003.  I'm obsessed... so?  john mayer was really sexy too, but he tried eating the microphone.  I love the man to death, but he's so weird when he sings, and has no rhythm.  People seemed to like our saying.  while everyone else shouted 'you're hot' or 'marry me' or 'john mayer rules', we were yelling 'john mayer, be my squeegee bitch!'.  We saw this article where he was talking about his first job, and he talked about how he was the best squeegee in the land, and how he could make the gas pump stop at exactly $15.  So, we made a poster that said 'John mayer- the best squeegee in the land'.  They wouldn't let us take it in, but they let someone else take their poster.  =(.  But everyone loved us for having an original saying.  It was a great concert, overall.      "

766556,female,indUnk,"        Monday blues   But, actually I'm not really very blue.  Feeling pretty good today.  Spending time with Leia yesterday may have something to do with it.   She is such a trip these days; she's only 3 but she speaks so clearly and expresses herself so well.   And she'll say hello to just about anyone, as long as mommy is close by.    Hmm, wonder if that would work to pick up men; guys use the baby decoy thing to pick up women, but I somehow don't think it works the same with men.  Although, I did have a man chat me up at the gas station; Leia wanted to drive and he said, 'Let her drive.  She can't be any worse than the old people around here.'  And then he smiled at me.  Hmmm....   Anyway, our new thing at home is to NOT say 'Hey!' because 'Hey' is for horses, according to Leia.  So I say it just to make her crazy.   Once when she was acting more like a wild animal than a girl I said, 'Hey, cut it out!'   Leia replied, 'Hay is for horses' and I said, 'Yeah, well, you're acting more like a horse than a girl, so I can say 'Hay!'.  She had no reply other than to weakly repeat herself, 'Hey is for horses, mommy.'  Now, everytime I say 'Hey' to someone, as in 'Hello' I automatically think of Leia's reprimand.

TinyE loves it, and I think her admiration for it is contagious. I am rocking it non-stop right now.  I also like this version of 'Simple Gifts' that traditional Quaker song by Yo Yo Ma and Alison Krauss.   2. ...food?   The Javanese tofu at Whole Foods.  Deeeelish! I'm also way into  urlLink these wraps .    3. ...tv show?   CBS Sunday Morning:  they just had their 25th Anniversary show, and it amazed me how many episodes Id seen.  I know I come off as nerdy for having that as a favorite (other favorites are 60 Minutes and The Simpsons), but if you ever watch it, you will be amazed by how they put together a phenomenal show every darn week, 52 times a year.    4. ...scent?   Honestly, I have been sick for so long, that I cant really detect any scents.  I dont have a strong sense of smell to begin with, and you add nasal and sinus congestion to the mix, and forget about it.  Past favorites:  puppy dog breath, new car, and napalm in the morning (it smells like victory).    5. ...quote? We have discovered dozens of weapons of mass destruction- related program activity.

649790,female,indUnk,"             It hasn't been a good day.  Firstly, I went to the Apple Store in town and they tell me the problem is probably the software, and the warranty doesn't cover software, only hardware. Then they tell me if I want them to check it out, it'll cost a $90 diagnostic fee, and then they'll give me a quote if I wanna repair the software. If it is a hardware problem, then it's covered under warranty. The whole process will take 3-4 days (or did she say it'll be 3-4 days b4 they get a LOOK at it? Which means it'll take at least 10 days altogether!)  I don't have Norton Utilities or Disk Doctor either. It could very well be a software problem that can be fixed by reinstalling my MS Word for OS X, or even reinstalling OS X itself. But i don't have the MS Office CD right now - it's with a friend.  Thing is, my warranty runs out in 6 days. So if i wanna get it fixed, i gotta do it quick. But i don't have the time to send it in 'coz i really need to finish researching and writing my essays! ARGH.  Basically I just want it done in the quickest way, less stress, NO $$$ spent. Everything costs so much in Australia!!  I'm gonna try another Apple Store near my place tomorrow, and see what they say. I'll call ahead though, and ask how much they charge for diagnostic fees etc. (The place i went to today didn't even take a look at my Mac!)   I think it's horribly unfair that they charge to tell you what's wrong with it. I can understand charging to fix the problem, but not for taking a look at it! Previously they had fixed a problem I had with the iBook on the spot (it wouldn't start up). Today they weren't even helpful! I don't get it.  Sigh...why don't I ever learn?           "

1103575,female,indUnk,"       When I was little, I used to be terrified of a lot of things.  Creakings in the attic {there  had  to be someone, or something there didn't there?}  being alone... sleeping away from home, and the dark, I was more scared of the dark I think than anything else {remnants of this still remain with me... but I didn't admit it.} I can't begin to explain how I ended up that way... my parents never gave me any cause to feel unsafe...  but for a terribly long time I hated the night, I hated going to bed.  The very thought of trying to sleep sent sparks of fear to my heart.  I would lay in bed wide awake,  feeling almost as if I had been placed  in a vacuum, a void of everything good.  There aren't words to describe to you how I felt.  I had forgotten about that until earlier today... it just came back to me all of a sudden.  I really was the oddest child.  I'm weird now, but so is everyone.   When I was little, I was just odd... strange...  what people must have thought of me...    "

Unfortunately, my children do not understand this.  I've gotten used to the 4 year old climbing into my queen-size bed with me maybe 3 nights out of the week.

1708471,female,indUnk,"           My mind is having a revolution of some sort I swear. It was just last week or like 3 days ago where I hated everything and was pissed off at so much and at myself. I was sick and I didn't feel like I was going to get better and I had so much homework too, I was so stressed out and I didn't want to deal with anything at all.   Now, I'm starting to get back on track. Not only am I feeling like ten times better, but I'm actually really happy again. I think I have more positive thoughts then negatives thoughts for the first time in a long time. Ya sure I still hate school and feel like I suck in that area, but I'm gaining confidence in hockey and that is helping soooooo much. I've been playing first line and working my ass off and just the accomplishment I give myself is really all I need.   Basically, I'm starting to do things on my own and actually stick up for myself. Sorry if I get pissy at you or anything or yell at you, but I'm just sick of so much shit that is so unnessicary to begin with.  It's so much added stress that I clearly don't need, so now I'm done with taking everything I get from people in and I'm not letting people treat me like I have no feelings because seriously I'm probably one of the most emotional people I know. I'm done with people making me feel like I'm the size of an ant and stepping up to the plate and addressing the issue. No more Mr. Nice Guy or Mrs. Nice Girl anymore.  Actually, I'm being way more positive on everything, I'm looking towards the positive side and going from there. From now on if people aren't giving me support, I'm going to tell them, and well I already kind of had. I'm one of those people who can get all the support from people they can get otherwise I have no confidence level at all. I'm also addressing issues not only that I have but multiple people have and trying to change something that should be changed and should be more positive.  I'm no longer going to be affected by other people or my negative thoughts and try my best to do my best and not get down on myself so much because that's one thing that I can get my hands on and change to make my life one step easier.  Although I'm still like totally utterly confused about my life and where it's going and about guys and what I really want, I feel like I've finally gotten a grip on my life to make it really go where I want it to go. I have more control over what I can do then what I can't do and what I believe I can do then what I believe I can't do. But hey you never know all this positiveness has really just come out of my ass and I may be bitching again in a week.

We're not really, but we do have our favorites - the Pistons, of course, will always be the 'home team' and the Yankees are just, well, cool, and now the Lightning - how can you not get swept away?? Well the Pistons just picked up game 1 in L.A. The last time I watched the Pistons in the finals against the Lakers it was 1989 and I was 12 and Isaiah Thomas and the Bad Boys picked up the title. That brings back memories, watching the games with Dad and Jason, thinking how cool Thomas was, and watching Magic and Kareem go down!! Basketball is the only sport that I fully understand. I understand turnovers, steals, the paint, and traveling. It is a little less exciting than hockey, I have to admit I enjoy the shoving, but in b-ball that's a foul.   So tonight I learned that the same man,  urlLink Bill Davidson , owns the Pistons and the Lightning. I'd say it's been a great year for him! Hopefully, it will be a REALLY great year for him with 2 teams winning titles!  I am saddened at the passing of President Reagan. As I've been hearing about all the pomp and circumstance planned for his funeral, I realized that this is the first President to die during my lifetime. The last President to die was Johnson in 1973. I remember when Reagan came to my hometown Lima, Ohio. We drove down the street and stood by the train tracks and cheered with our neighbors as his train went by. My grandparents took my brother out to the airport and my Grandpa got some pretty good pictures of the President. That seems like a lifetime ago.               "

3429420,male,Student,"       The young elf ducked as a blade shimmered past, at the same time lashing out and hamstringing his brutish foe. The orc gave a deafening roar and fell to the ground like a huge tree shaking the ground. The thin elf stepped aside nimbly, avoiding the collapsing bulk. Drawing his dagger, he bent down and delivered the killing blow.  The champion looked up from the dead body and saw that his comrades weren’t doing so well. Many of them had fallen before the orcish onslaught. He knew any moment from now would mean life and death. He raced with elegant steps across the slaughter ground avoiding the corpses on the ground.   “To me!” Mansuetus commanded as he raises his sword high so everyone could see. Within minutes the elves formed a circle around him raising their spears high threatening anyone who comes within a metre length. He surveyed his disciplined soldiers proudly. The well-trained elves did not fail him. A few orcs made a daring attempt trying to carve its way through but only ended but with spears through his torso. “ Hold! Elves and you would live. Expect no quarters, for you would give them none!” The leader bellowed and every elf shouted in a single tone.” Hundred of orcs surrounded them waiting for a hole the defenses. A few orcs again made daring attempts but soon ended up dead. It seems the orcs weren’t as patient, Mansuetus thought as a smirk appeared on his face. “ On my command, you would send this brutes to wherever they came from!” He shouted a command in the ancient language to the crossbowmen. The crossbowmen loaded their crossbow and nodded in understanding.  Finally the orcs patient was at an end, the green skins roared and shouted war cries in their primitive language. “Now!” the champion signaled and spears was leveled to the eye and sound of crossbows unleashing death. This was what he savored every moment as the orcs lumbered into the wall of spikes. Steel met steel, blood splattered everywhere and sound of screams and shouts filled the air. “ Fight on my elves and fight well for this day you will replenish the blood within your armors!” Mansuetus charged in fray of combat, slashing and hacking as he went. An orc twice the shoulder length of him and was the largest orc he had ever seen. The massive orc bawled a challenge, and was quickly answered.   Through the visor he stare into the eye of his foe trying to anticipate his every move. The orc wield his axe menacingly and gave an evil laughter. “Fle’ be fo  ma, da wil‘ na de fet ma.” His voice boomed loudly as he made his unstoppable assault. Mansuetus parried with every ounce of strength and speed he could muster. Strands of hair flew as he avoided the humongous axe only by an inche. He saw an opening and made a riposte attack only to see his blade bouncing harmlessly off the orc tough hide. What would appear a grin appeared on the orc ugly face. Beads of perspiration dripped down his delicate face. He was panting heavily and he felt he could not hold off the assault anymore. His bones ache like a rusty mechanism. His green skin foe seems to be tireless only to be laughing and fighting. Fear gripped him like a vice.  Darkness descended. His eyes were wide opened, he groaned in pain. Blood streamed down from his open wound. Every strands of strength was sapped away from him, he could no longer feel his legs, and his limbs were drained. He dropped his axe and crashed into the ground. Mansuetus took moments to realize that a shadowy figure was at the standing at the back of the orc general. He wanted to laugh at the moment but could not. From the shadows came a calmed voice, “Thou have done well Mansuetus, champion of fifth regiment of the Shadow Warriors.” Only to realized he was the assassin, whom his general had spoken well of Mansuetues made a courtly bow and said, “ I thank thee for thine compliment for if thou wouldst have saved me, and I wouldst have fallen to these cursed orcs.”  “The battle is over, assemble the elves and have them report back to the camp immediately,” he spoke softly.  Mansuetus nodded and said, “Yes, my lord.”        Mansuetus walked into his simple house, he took off his armour and took his scabbard and hang it by the side. “Mansuetus! You are finally home I was so worried about you.” Mliara said excitedly as tears swelled in her eyes. She was a beautiful woman, with striking features and fine figure. She ran over to embrace him, and kissed him deeply. Fatigue of the battle and heat of love conflict, and he spoke softly, “I missed you greatly, but I am tired now I wish to rest.” He gave a reassuring smile and wiped the tears softly away from her face. “I have prepared your clothing and when you have finish bathing, we can have a good feast tonight.” He took up his fresh clothing and walked over to the river.   He could see the clear water flowing gushing down the endless river. The wind blew softly and the leaves rustled. He stripped off his bloodstained tunic and entered the refreshing water. He rested on the rocks by the riverbank and enjoys the peaceful and soothing ambience. Life was too perfect for a moment he had a caring and lovely wife and recently he was promoted to captain of his regiment. The extra income would provide a better life for his wife and he himself. He opened his eyes lazily not knowing for how long he had slept. Suddenly sound of splashing water made him jumped to his feet. He quickly put on the robes his wife had sewn for him and with drew the dagger in his boots. He sneaked among the bushes, his natural talents made him moving like a cat, among the bushes. He crouched down and to his horror he saw bands of men dressed in barbaric helms and leather clothing wading through the river.   He quickly made his way back to his house and put on his battle equipment. He and his wife quickly made their way out of the house. Every second lost would mean life and death. They ran as fast as their legs could carry them. Suddenly shouts could be heard. Mansuetus heart raced, as he knew the enemy had spotted them. Mliara tripped on a piece of rock and fell, blood was spotted on her knees. “Mliara!” shouted the battle-trained warrior.   “I can..not…..go on any fur..ther, Mansuetus you must…carry on!” she slurred as tears burst forth from her.   “My love I cannot go on without you, if we must die we must die together.” He ran back and carries her on the back. “You cannot run fast enough if you would carry me, they would soon catch up with us.” Perspiration streamed down his face, muscles tensed as he ran with all his might. Sound of his pursuers came closer and closer; he knew with every step they make they would be one more step towards the city. The chaos men were coming closer and closer. He fought on against the endless tide. What would have seemed forever, he thought ended with a loud thud sound. Droplets of blood glittering in the sun spurted forth. Grief and sorrow overwhelmed him. He stopped and slowly put her down by the side of a tree. An arrow protruded through her chest. “I’m sorry my loved one,” she said drawing all the energy within her. Her eyes closed and he knew she was dead. He gripped his sword and there was a glint of madness in his eyes. Blood course through his veins. He invoked the name of Khaine and turned around to face the chaos worshippers. A muscular man held a bow in his hand and smiled, happy that he had shot the target but soon his smile was gone as he head rolled off to the ground.   Mansuetus, captain of fifth regiment of the Shadow Warriors fought with frenzy and hatred. He was cutting left and right beheading anyone who come within the tip of his blade. The chaos worshippers soon learn to fear him, they surrounded him and no one dared to attempt an attack. He glared menacingly at his foes, if it was as if just a look of his eyes to even cause fear in the heart of a stout dwarf. He swings his blade in a sinister way. Light danced off from his blood-forged armour, the runes on his sleeves glowed brightly. Instead of waiting he lunged forward skewering the groin and hamstringing another. More chaos men formed up around him. Only rage and sorrow were gushing through him. In his eyes he knew no fear. Regardless of his own life he charged into the tide. Hacking and slashing and hewed a path though the chaos men. But slowly he was overwhelmed no matter how fast he could dodge or strike he was unable to. The chaos men swarmed down on him and held him tightly. He roared in rage and bit his teeth into his tongue the sweet taste of blood filled his mouth. Veins were bulging up as he struggled frantically.   A group of elves charged into the fray and it was all too much for the chaos worshippers. They turned and fled ignoring leaving their weapons on the ground. Mansuetus lay on the ground filled with cuts and bruises. A huge scar was evidently marked on his armour only missing his flesh only by a few inche. His eyes were vacant; he felt life has no meaning with the death of his wife. “We spotted this band after a few peasants had sounded the alarm. We apologies for the late arrival.” The leader’s words contained sympathy and fear. He ordered two of his men to aid him to stand. Their faced betrayed irritation as they tried to push it back. Mansuetus staggered across to his wife and knelt beside her. Tears swelled in his eyes, as he buried his head in his wife hair. “ Please wake up my love, I beg of you.”           "

He reminded me:  30 years ago, a black man couldn't use the same toilet as a white man.  It was considered 'fundamentally wrong', and segration was 'right'.    Less than 100 years ago, women couldn't vote in this country.  It was unheard of, and well, 'fundamentally wrong'.    Maybe 20 years from now, gay marriage will have moved into the realm of desegregation and suffrage.  Something that just had to be allowed, because how could it possibly be otherwise?

What was I supposed to say earlier on? Oh yes...while sitting somewhere to expel the shit from my system or better known as egestion in biological terms, I was reminded of the crazy moments in first 3 months SRJC of 2004...especially when the first intake were rather nice too...with the retainees very friendly to us intakees as well.   On a beautiful Thursday morning, all the classes had gathered at the parade ground, from 1A01 to 1A07,&nbsp;and from&nbsp;1S01 to 1S24, preparing to be led by their CT away to their new classes. But alas! The tutors had told us to attend our venue of first tutorial/lecuture by ourselves which caused a great furore amongst us. It was kinda' funny too 'cause we weren't very used to the new system of self-initiation, which is to be used to the system whereby our secondary school teacher would bring us back to our classrooms shortly after morning assembly or silent reading period there.     &nbsp; Quite nostalgic, ain't it? It was quite a boring and lame joke...but the feeling was there if you had been a 1st intake SRJC student. At the moment, SRJC is filled with weirder people who do not have the warmth of the intakees. (Most of us either fled to TJ, CJ, TPJ&nbsp;or VJ etc. I was an exception....flew off to YJ instead of entering 'proper' JCs meant for my kind of character.)   Okay, enough of such rubbish already. Let's simply hope for the best in the future...while I miss my SRJC friends who are mostly in TPJ at the current moment. T_T~!          "

I even got to do a TV interview last night.  That's right, I've graduated from print to television.  I'm not quite sure how its going to turn out and I'm not sure I want to see it when it does air.  We'll see... that may be my limit on those 15 minutes of fame. ;)  Heading out for a very quiet weekend (I hope).  Have a fabulous weekend for me!  Diva out.           "

3868966,female,Education,"       Well I'm not sure what a Blog is and so this will be me figuring it out as I go.  LOL of all things I'm in a pretty crappy mood tonight too.  Joy.  I have lots I should be journaling about and I guess I might as well work on it here.  I used to have an Open Diary, a site that is still near and dear to my heart.  But that got compromised by someone and I took it down and then never had the umphf to start over.  Whats on my mind tonight.  Who knows.  Well what WAS on my mind this morning at work was this.  He spent the night last night.  That was cool, always is very nice to be in his arms.  To be aware of his warmth all night.  I actually didn't sleep much last night.  Told him this morning that I didn't know why but I do know.  I may only have 4 more weeks with him.  4 more weeks to last my lifetime of having someone hold me and love me for no reason, just because they do.  He holds me...all day sometimes.  I love the morning light shining on his face as he wakes next to me....his blue eyes gazing back at me with his soft smile.    Lying in the darkness, just before sleep sometimes he tells me things.  Last week he drifted off in my arms and when I had to leave he woke and told me he knew he was falling.  And I said I know.  I held him for longer before I finally had to leave.  The other night we were sleeping and he sat up in the night...sort of upset or sad.  He said baby i just don't want to lose you.  And I said so don't and held him and he fell back to sleep with me.  It's like his fears and heart show in the dark of night.  And I know because mine do too.  When we drank cider the other night...things started to be said that we feel...and are afraid to say.  I still can't say it so much in words.  I want to and I miss him so much tonight it aches.  But early this morning...before the sun rose, I looked over at him and he reached for me in his sleep and held me close to his chest.  Said I love you baby.  I said I love you too...then I held him so tight....so much it hurt because I ache for him, ache to tell him what's in my heart.  Ache to be with him and really give all of me to him.  It's ripping me open that in a month or so it may be over.  Maybe not...but what if.  What if it all changes...we go apart...  I know we can live through that...but that's not the point.  I can't spend my life wondering what would have been if we had given this a real go.  In my dreams I want to share a home, to have him come home for dinner at night and to wake with him every day.  I want to play our games and watch our movies and have our friends.  I want to see what our babies would look like and take them places.  To make pictures of us that match the dreams in my heart.  How could I have known that he would be so much so soon and that I would never want to let him go.    I think I'll stop with that cuz I don't wanna talk about what I don't wanna talk about anyhoo.                            "
649790,female,indUnk,"               It All Makes Sense Now!!    As you all know, I've been writing Silly Songs (aptly named Silly Songs with Sarah) for awhile now. To the unenlightened, Silly Songs are basically ditties that just pop into my head once in awhile, outta blue, totally off-guard. They could be lyrics to well-known songs (a la Weird Al Yankovic) or just, well, songs with a tune.  Here's a sample:   (To the tune of Kylie's 'I Just Can't Get You Outta My Head')   I just can't get you outta my spleen Boy oh boy do I need anti-fungal cream   Also:   (To the tune of P.O.D.'s 'Alive')   I can't see at night For the very first time I believe I am blind So blind  I can't drive past nine Otherwise I'll die But night blindness is fine So fine     Anyways, I just came across, in one of my readings, a man named Philip J. Kitchen!! So now this ditty I came up with a YEAR ago, FINALLY makes sense!   *Ahem*   Kill Kenny Chicken....But don't kill the Kitchen.... (repeat)   Please don't ask me who Kenny Chicken is. I have no idea. Just some figment of my subconcious I suppose. BUT! Now we DO know how kitchens can be killed - when they're human!! Heeheeheeteeheehee... (Previously,  'don't kill the kitchen' came with a 'with germs lah!' reply to people's perplexed expressions.)  There of course have been times when these ditties have come back to bite me on the ass, unintentionally of course (no malicious content, and all G-rated songs ok?!). I recorded one as my voice-mail message, and left it there for quite awhile. Thing is, a potential employer for this job I really wanted to try out for after I graduated, but which I thought wouldn't come through 'coz he hadn't called for months since I put the application in, finally gave me a tinkle on the phone! And I didn't hear the phone. So it got redirected. And he heard the song.

883178,male,Fashion,"            A Short Commentary on Thongs: Pros & Cons   Pros:  1) Thongs are great if it's Saturday night and you feel like wearing that kicky pair of tight black pants and you want to avoid the dreaded 'underwear line'. (HAL, there's no way you're getting me to use the P-word.) 2) Guys love them...they just do.  Wear one, and certain guys may just buy you a car...or at least a bus pass.  Cons: 1) They are so fricking uncomfortable.  I don't care what certain girls say...'You just have to get used to them, and then you'll never even feel them!'  You people are liars, because I think I would no longer be human if I suddenly became 'comfortable' with something lodged up my butt crack.  But Dirty may disagree - refer to his latest post. 2) Some girls always have them sticking out of their pants.  (Celebrity sightings: Britney and Christina) Two words, DJS: low class.  My coworker, Thong, has her's practically up to the middle of her back...what the hell is that?  Can she not feel it?  Once I actually commented: 'Um, Thong, your underwear is sticking WAY out...'  (I've never been accused of having filters, you know.)  Her response?  'Oh, my red ones!  You like them?'  Are you kidding?  No, dumbass, I wasn't  complimenting  them, I was telling you you're a white trash whore.    How can I make this any clearer?           "
4187809,female,Communications-Media,"             Was doing my devotional today, and I read something that really struck me.. It was a passage talking about Satan, and how he is a deceiver, a liar...  'When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies.' John 8:44  The spiritual realm is real... if we believe that there is a God, then there must be a devil. There's a spiritual war out there that we're fighting in, there's no such thing as being a pacifist in this war - you're either  for  God, or  against  God.  So how does the devil go about the task of attacking God's people? Reading from Selwyn Hughes' book, 'Everyday with Jesus' (a backdated issue)... he says...   'Satan's major weapon is always that of temptation. This is how he achieved success in bringing about the downfall of Adam and Eve - and it is his chief weapon still. Satan used a strategy which proved so successful, and it is still one he uses to this very day.  Satan did not attempt to get Adam and Eve to become atheists because he knew that was an impossibility. So he focused instead on getting them to  doubt God's goodness . The devil began by saying, 'Did God really say, 'You must not eat from any tree in the garden?' (Gen 3:1). That question was formed in such a way that it introduced the first human pair to something they had not come up against before - an attack on the  character of God . Eve then explained the situation, and this gave the devil further opportunity to sow doubt on God's goodness. 'you will not surely die,' he said (Gen 3:4). The implication behind these words was the suggestion that if God really loved them He would not have limited them in that way.'   Wow, that passage really sunk deep into my Spirit. There  have  been times when i doubted the goodness of God, and asked Him (more like yelled, actually...) 'where are you, God! Do you even care?' How can I even trust you when I can't see you, or I can't hear you? But in His 'silence'.. a lot of times, there comes a peace.. (especially after yelling and crying to God).. that I can't quite explain, and it is during those times that my spirit within me says... 'He does care... '  I think learning to trust Him and walk His path even though the road seems dark is one of the hardest things to do as a Christian. But there is that thing within me that hangs on still.. and says... 'He does care.. don't give up...'            "
2844168,female,Marketing,"                 How familiar are you with the flag code?? Did you know that the flag is to be displayed on all days, but especially days such as New Year's Day, Inauguration Day, Mother's Day (no mention of Father's Day, sorry!) and the birthdays of the States? Did you know that the flag is never to be used for advertising purposes or printed or embroidered on items that are meant for temporary use and discard such as napkins or boxes? Also, the flag represents a living country and is itself considered a living thing. Therefore, the lapel flag pin being a replica, should be worn on the left lapel near the heart.

If I don't find a suitable internet cafe (scoff, cough and more scoffing) then a detailed entry will be on the order when I get back.  Ack. Hotels cost too much there. Here, in this stupid town (and in most of Oregon) the prices per room for a single are around $29-35. The cheapest hotel ('Berkeley Budget Inn') was about $63/night. And the prices increased exponentially from that; think Hotel 6 costing $200+ a night. Wow. That's my last paycheck - I worked for  two weeks .  And, luckily, I still have most of it (actually it was $256 but after taxes...so sad) and can spend it on crap in San Francisco. Who would have thought, MY stepdad taking me down there.

And get a ride to the airport at about 8 (car).  This I hop on my 35 minute flight to Newark (plane; yeah I know, it was dumb, but flyi.com doesn't start flying to JFK till next month or something).  After taxiing and everything it took about 2 hours.  Then I hop on a shuttle to Grand Central Station (bus), the Jersey transit system , in their infinite wisdom, decided that only one lane was required for entrance into New York City.  So my 35 minute bus ride took 2 hours.  I get to the train station and look for the next train, well this was convenient, there was only one left.  I had missed the 11:22, and the 12:22 so it's the 1:30 for me.  I don't know if any of you have taken the 1:30 outta GCT, but unless you're intoxicated it's not fun.  It's like the drunk tank at county (does anyone know what county is?  Just sounded like somthing Perry Mason would say, or better yet, Matlock).  To top this off there was a Phish concert in NYC.  And if you know anything about me, you know I don't like Phish.  So me on a train with a bunch of drunk and high kids.  To top it off, the 1:30 makes EVERY stop through to Connecticut, so my 45 minute ride (train) took 2 hours.  Finally I roll into Trumbull at 3:30 and get to sleep.... 'till 9.  Saturday was nice, the wedding was pretty and stuff.  I really wasn't feeling the Catholic sercive, although who does. 'Honor' this, and 'serve' that, and 'make him a cheese sammich woman.'  The reception was cool, very Italian, but I ended up making friends with a cousin of mine that I haven't seen in like 8 to 10 years.  She's cool.  Danced like a fucking freak, caught holy hell for that the rest of the weekend.  But 'sall good, when the three of us (Todd, Traci and I) get together it's in good fun.  Went to bed at like 2... 'till 6.  Sunday was really cool.  Went to the U.S. Open, not really a golf fan, but the weather was incredible and it's just overall a cool experience.  Kinda bummed that Phil doubled the 17th, but ehh... there was some good golf played.  This is a conversation I had with my brother's fiancewhile whatching some guys put on the 16th green.  Meg: Where's the hole? Trav: Megan you gotta remember these thing, jeeze. Meg: Do you know where the hole is? Trav: I got a couple ideas.  We got outta there at like 7:45, crammed 4 people in the back of my sister's Pathfinder.  And started a horrible trip through long island.  4 hours later (and about 50 miles), we roll into Manhattan and drop off Todd and Megan.  Then we trade off and each drive a bit.  My shift came on at 1:30 and was the last leg.  I was so tired, being in the sun all day and all.  Finally roll in at about 3:30.  All in all, horrible trip, but some perspective; it still was shorter than my trip up there... and I flew.             "
589736,male,Technology,"              can't read it without a password so here's the article  Hady Hassan Omar's Detention By MATTHEW BRZEZINSKI   Hady Hassan Omar had made up his mind. He was going to kill himself if he wasn't released by New Year's Eve.   It wouldn't be easy. Three cameras recorded his every move. The lights in his cell weren't turned off for weeks at a time. And the guards watching him through the plate-glass wall were rotated round the clock. He would lie under his prison-issue blanket for as many as 20 hours a day. It was the only privacy he could get.   Since his arrest on Sept. 12, 2001, Omar had been fighting a losing battle. No one would believe that he had simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time. He passed polygraph tests, but the F.B.I. still seemed convinced that he was linked to Al Qaeda. The guards in the isolation wing of Pollock maximum-security penitentiary in Louisiana kept telling him that under new antiterror measures, he could sit in jail forever. He wrote the attorney general. He even went on several hunger strikes. But the corrections officers just threatened to strap him to a gurney and force-feed him through a tube up his nose.   Omar was running out of the little hope he had left. His only solace now was prayer. He became convinced that he would never leave this place. His baby daughter, Jasmine, would take her first steps, utter her first words and grow up without him. If he could not be with her on her first birthday in December, he decided, life was not worth living.    There are many ways to break a man, to make sure he is not holding anything back. Causing physical pain may be the quickest method, but it is not necessarily the most effective. To be absolutely certain that someone is telling the truth, you have to crush his spirit.   That is what Hady Hassan Omar says the United States government tried to do to him in the days and weeks that followed Sept. 11. He was one of hundreds of Muslim immigrants held in solitary confinement for months without charges while the F.B.I. investigated their backgrounds. His 73 days of captivity, he claims in a lawsuit recently filed in the Western District of Louisiana, rose ''to the level of torture.'' Hoping that publicity about his ordeal might help his case, Omar and his family agreed to give details of it in a series of interviews arranged by their attorney, Robert Rubin of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights, a nonprofit group based in San Francisco.   Though his suit is the first of its kind, Omar is not alone in making such serious allegations. ''We have documented many instances in which immigrants from the Middle East and South Asian countries like Pakistan have faced cruel and degrading treatment at the hands of U.S. authorities,'' says William F. Schulz, the executive director of Amnesty International U.S.A. ''Those are the sort of practices we usually see in the most repressive regimes in the world.''   No one knows exactly how many young Muslim men were rounded up in the aftermath of 9/11. As of November of last year, when federal authorities stopped issuing information on the subject, the tally was 1,147. What is known is that thus far, of those initial 1,147 arrests, only 3 have resulted in terrorism-related indictments, and more than 400 people have been deported following lengthy internment periods and closed hearings.   At issue is the key question lawmakers have been grappling with since the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon: just how far can America go to protect itself, both at home and abroad? For the attorney general's office, it is a delicate balancing act. The interests of national security must be weighed against constitutional guarantees, the safety of 280 million citizens squared against the rights of a few, or a few thousand, individuals -- mostly foreign nationals.   The United States has not faced such a quandary since the attack on Pearl Harbor, when it was deemed necessary to intern 110,000 Japanese and people of Japanese descent, 70,000 of whom were United States citizens, to stop possible sabotage or espionage. Since 9/11, the Bush administration has been wrestling with the difficult task of arming the justice system with the legal weapons needed to fight the new threat. Much of the work has had to be veiled in secrecy for fear of tipping off the terrorists, and the emergency measures have sought to curtail some of the freedoms that extremists could employ to avoid detection, arrest and prosecution.   But as time passes since the trauma of Sept. 11, the cost to individual rights is beginning to come into focus. David Cole, a Georgetown University law professor, argues that ''the policy of keeping people in jail until the F.B.I. clears them is essentially 'guilty until proven innocent.'''   Anthony Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, agrees. ''It's fundamentally un-American,'' he says. ''What's most troubling is that the American public is being kept in the dark about what is being done in the name of the war on terror.'' The A.C.L.U. has sued under the Freedom of Information Act to obtain the names of some of the detainees.   In New York, a class-action suit filed in April on behalf of at least 87 detainees, separate from the A.C.L.U. suit, accuses the Justice Department of wholesale violations of the constitutional rights to which both American citizens and noncitizens in the United States are entitled. Several rulings by federal judges over the past few months indicate that the detainees could get a sympathetic hearing.   There are many who believe that the necessity of preventing future terrorist attacks supersedes the rights of any individual, that standards of due process must be amended to suit extreme circumstances. ''Human rights norms recognize that in times of grave emergency, governments can take steps that are different from peacetime so long as they are strictly necessary and proportional,'' says Ruth Wedgwood, a professor of international law at Yale and a former federal prosecutor. ''On Sept. 11 no one knew the extent of the threat, whether Al Qaeda succeeded in finding fissile materials, so there was great concern that the other shoe might drop.''   Ultimately, the issue will be for the Supreme Court and historians to decide. With Al Qaeda sleeper cells still possibly in the United States and Osama bin Laden still possibly at large, officials in Washington are reluctant to reveal tactics or discuss specifics or even to answer the charges leveled against them in particular cases. For now, what little is known about the methods used on the domestic front of the war on terror comes largely from the personal accounts of former detainees like Omar.   is trouble began on Sept. 12 with a knock at the door of the house in Fort Smith, Ark., that Omar was staying in with his second wife, Candy (his first marriage, also to an American, ended in divorce), and Jasmine. The visitor was a man wearing jeans and a white polo shirt. A service revolver hung from his belt, and he carried a gold shield identifying him as a deputy from the nearby sheriff's office. Two other men were waiting outside, next to an unmarked S.U.V. parked in the driveway.   ''They just want to ask me a few questions,'' Omar told Candy. She remembers that Omar didn't look especially worried, just a little tired. The day before, he had spent 14 hours at the Houston airport after his Sept. 11 flight from Florida was grounded, along with all air traffic in the country. ''I'll be home soon,'' he promised, with only a hint of the Egyptian accent that Candy had found exotic when he first asked for her phone number at the Electric Cowboy club some 16 months back.   Candy might have been more concerned had she seen the F.B.I. agent handcuff her husband. But even when she went to the small F.B.I. office in Fort Smith to answer questions later that afternoon, the gravity of the situation had not yet dawned on her. ''I wasn't scared or anything,'' she recalled.   The F.B.I. agents, after all, were relaxed and friendly, she remembers, and assured her that they simply needed to ask routine questions about a concealed-weapons permit Omar had applied for after joining a local gun club. Still, the line of questioning seemed somewhat incongruous. ''One kept asking if Hady was a good Muslim,'' she says. ''I said not really.'' It was true that Omar would not eat pork. But he didn't pray five times a day, go to mosque or deny himself the occasional vodka or Marlboro Ultra Light. An affable federal agent named Ed sat next to Candy in the waiting room, passing the time watching the television news. He would periodically point at the photos of the 19 hijackers that the networks showed and ask Candy if she'd ever seen any of them before. Candy didn't have a clue how the F.B.I. could possibly have linked her husband to the lead hijacker.    'Am I here because I'm Egyptian?'' Omar asked once as he was being taken into the F.B.I. interrogation room, where he was joined by another agent who introduced himself as Mike. The F.B.I., he says, had taken his weapons permit, his driver's license, Social Security card, work permit and the 13 credit cards he accumulated during his two years in America. ''I'll need those back,'' Omar said. He had an interview with the Immigration and Naturalization Service to get a green card in a few days, and he was going off on holiday with Candy to celebrate their first wedding anniversary. Don't worry, he was assured, just tell us about your friends. The F.B.I. wanted names and numbers, and whenever Omar gave them one, an agent would scribble it down on a piece of paper and leave the room. (The Fort Smith F.B.I. branch office declined to comment on this account, as did Brian Marshall, a spokesman for the Bureau's Arkansas headquarters in Little Rock.)   Candy, meanwhile, had signed a consent form allowing the search of their apartment; agents removed their home computer, documents, credit-card statements and correspondence, his collection of Arabic-language videos and a copy of ''Scarface,'' the Al Pacino gangster movie.   At that point, Omar says, he was still most worried that all this would somehow affect his credit rating. He had signed up for all those credit cards and even taken a few small bank loans because he was told that was how one built a credit history in America, and he dreamed of owning his own business someday. On Sept. 11, he had been in Florida, working out the details, he says, of an Egyptian antiques store he was hoping to open with a friend who worked for Lucent Technologies in Cairo.   Candy stayed at the F.B.I.'s Fort Smith office answering questions until just after 11 p.m. Then she was told she could leave. Her husband, though, would not be coming with her.   The next morning, Candy Omar woke to find the banner headline ''Terror Strikes Home'' blazing across the front page of the Fort Smith newspaper, The Times Record, over a four-column photograph of her handcuffed husband being led away to the county jail.   His arrest was on all the local stations as well, as were neighbors and former co-workers expressing varying degrees of shock, disbelief and outrage. Omar had not, in fact, been charged with any crime, but the media accounts glossed over that. On his papers, the line reserved for charges read vaguely: ''Hold for I.N.S.''   The F.B.I., it turned out, did have some potentially damning evidence: Omar bought his Sept. 11 plane tickets from the very same computer terminal in the same Boca Raton, Fla., Kinko's outlet that Mohamed Atta had used, around the same time too. And he fit the hijackers' profile perfectly: young, from a well-to-do background -- his father was an engineer working in Qatar - computer-literate, with a taste for vodka and nightclubs, just like Atta. It made sense that the F.B.I. would want to talk to him. But was his ticket purchase merely a coincidence? Or was Hady Hassan Omar part of the plot?   At Candy's apartment, the phone rang incessantly. Omar's friend Gary called to say she should forget about her husband and move on with her life. Omar called, too, from jail. ''He sounded hysterical,'' Candy says. ''He begged me to believe that he wasn't a murderer or involved in any way.''   Around noon, the F.B.I. agents returned to Omar's holding cell in the county jail, this time in suits and ties. They had with them another agent flown up from Little Rock who asked Omar if he knew what a lie-detector test was. ''Yeah,'' Omar said. ''Like in 'Meet the Parents''' -- the comedy where Robert DeNiro plays a retired C.I.A. officer who subjects prospective sons-in-law to polygraphs.   After the electrodes were strapped to his chest and index and ring fingers and a blood-pressure gauge was wrapped around his bicep, a series of seven questions began -- repeated three times in different order. Some were innocuous: Is your date of birth Jan. 19, 1979? Others less so: Were you planning on hitting U.S. targets or hurting Americans?   The test lasted 90 minutes, then Omar waited. Good news, said the agent from Little Rock when he finally returned, all smiles now and patting Omar on the back. Omar was told he had passed. ''I was so relieved,'' he recalled. He would make his green-card hearing after all, and in a few days he'd be celebrating his wedding anniversary with Candy at a spa in Hot Springs, all this a bad memory. ''I can go now, right?'' he asked eagerly.    What Omar did not know was that in Washington, officials were working round the clock to come up with emergency legal guidelines to fight the war on terror. No one knew where or when Al Qaeda would strike next, and the F.B.I., Immigration and Naturalization Service and other government agencies were under fire for what was seen as their failure to detect the Sept. 11 attacks.   It would take six weeks for the final package of antiterror measures, known as the U.S.A. Patriot Act, to get through Congress and be signed into law by President Bush. But in the meantime the dangers facing America were very real, and the I.N.S. was enlisted to buy time for the F.B.I. Leads had to be followed up, stories checked out, bank records and phone logs verified. All this was painstakingly slow work, and by law suspects could not be detained for more than 24 hours without being charged with a crime.   Though married to an American, Omar did not yet have permanent-resident status, which made him vulnerable. The I.N.S. can hold immigrants for overstaying tourist or student visas, taking too few college credits or any number of other violations. They could begin deportation proceedings against illegal aliens and keep them locked up if they were deemed a risk to flee or a danger to the community. It was all perfectly legal, as long as the detainees were charged under immigration statutes within 24 hours. After 9/11, that time frame was extended to 48 hours by the Justice Department, then seven days. In special ''emergency'' cases, says Bill Strassberger, a spokesman for the I.N.S. in Washington, detainees can now be held without charges for a ''reasonable'' period.   On Sept. 21, 2001, the Justice Department issued a memorandum reversing the detainee's right to open immigration hearings. In ''special-interest cases,'' according to the memorandum, hearings would be held behind closed doors. The immigration courts would not be required to confirm whether such cases were on the docket, and not even the relatives of detainees would be allowed to attend the secret hearings. ''Opening sensitive immigration hearings could compromise the security of our nation and our ongoing investigations,'' Barbara Comstock, a Justice Department spokeswoman, later elaborated in a statement. ''We are at war, facing a terrorist threat from unidentified foes who operate in covert ways and unknown places. This makes it essential that the United States take every legal step possible to protect the American people from acts of terrorism.''   Attorney General John Ashcroft himself recently defended the Bush administration's decision to beef up security measures at the expense of individuals' rights. ''History instructs us,'' he said, during a September 2002 address to United States attorneys in New York, ''that caution and complacency are not defenses of freedom: caution and complacency are a capitulation before freedom's enemies -- the terrorists.''    In several conversations and in the details of his suit, Omar has laid out his version of what happened next. While the case remains to be tried, this is the picture that emerges from his allegations.   Though Omar was told that he had passed his lie-detector test, he was hardly in the clear. Late in the afternoon of Sept. 13, 2001, he says, an armed I.N.S. agent in a cowboy hat served him with a document known as ''a notice to appear.'' Omar had no idea what that meant. It was not a criminal charge, he assumed, yet he was being taken for mug shots and fingerprinting.   You overstayed your tourist visa, the I.N.S. agent declared. ''But I'm legal,'' Omar stammered, perplexed, since his marriage to an American citizen made him eligible for permanent residency. ''I've got a work permit and everything.''   Sometime after midnight, he says, several I.N.S. agents slapped leg irons on him and cuffed him to a thick chain that was wrapped around his waist. Omar was put in the back of a tan Chevy sedan. ''Where are we going?'' he asked as they sped off. ''What's happening?'' No one said anything. They drove through the night, listening to country music.   ''I kept asking for an attorney,'' Omar recalls. ''Finally one of the agents in the car lost his temper and yelled: 'Listen, let me explain this to you. We're not going to baby-sit you like the F.B.I.'''   Omar still had no idea where they were taking him, though he could tell by the road signs that they had crossed over to Louisiana. The sun was already up when they pulled into a gas station, where an unmarked Ford Explorer and a police cruiser were waiting for them.   Their destination was an I.N.S. office in Oakdale, La. Omar, still in shackles, was taken into a room with a large glass partition. ''Everyone in the office was staring at me as if I was something nasty or dirty,'' he says. He had been handcuffed for 12 hours and was dizzy with hunger. ''I asked them to take off the cuffs. But the guard just said hell no.''   Several hours later, Omar was moved again, this time to the New Orleans Parish Prison. He says he was ordered to strip and spread his legs before being searched, issued a jumpsuit and allowed to call Candy.   She had been frantic and afraid to leave her apartment. The call from her husband, however, galvanized her into action. She arranged to drop Jasmine off with her mother, emptied their $700 bank account and drove south to Louisiana. The trip took more than 12 hours, and by the time she arrived at the New Orleans Parish Prison, Omar was already gone. He had been transferred in the middle of the night to a maximum-security prison, and when Candy called, no one would tell her if he was even there.   ''I begged the administrator,'' Candy recalls. ''I said, 'He is my husband -- I need to find him!' But the woman just said, 'I think national security is more important right now.'''    All across America, Muslim men were literally disappearing into the prison system. On Sept. 20, 2001, Shakir Baloch, a Canadian citizen of Pakistani origin, was arrested in New York by the I.N.S. and F.B.I., and despite official inquiries from Ottawa, his detention was not disclosed for more than three months. He was held for half a year before being sent back to Canada. In California, an Egyptian-born dentist was taken into custody at a Los Angeles-area gas station, and while his friends searched for him in local jails, he was flown to a detention center in Brooklyn. In New Jersey, Anser Mehmood's wife spent six weeks searching for her husband, who was arrested in late September, not formally charged with a visa violation until March 2002 and held in an isolation cell with 24-hour lighting for seven months. The wife of an Egyptian national arrested in early September did not see her husband until Dec. 19, 2001. She passed on a letter he wrote to Amnesty International. ''I have now been in solitary confinement for three and a half months. . . . Why am I imprisoned? What are they accusing me of?''    It was only when he got to the maximum-security federal penitentiary in Pollock, La., sometime after 2 the next morning, that Omar realized the severity of his situation, as he charges in his lawsuit against the government. No one even knew he was there, and he was not permitted to make any calls. Strip, he was told, once again. A dozen officials, including two women, he recalls, looked on. Someone produced a camcorder and began taping as Omar undressed. Omar stood naked while his body cavities were searched for the third time in less than four days.   He still has trouble speaking in front of his wife about what happened next. ''They told me to lift my testicles,'' Omar remembers, blushing slightly. ''One of the guards pointed at my backside and said, 'You sure you're not hiding anything in there?' I said no. 'I think he's got something in there,' he told the others.'' One of the corrections officers, he says, placed a call, and a man in white medical scrubs entered the room. He wore a latex glove. Bend over, he said. Squinting from the pain, Omar looked up at one of the I.N.S. guards who had escorted him from the New Orleans prison. She was laughing, he says. (A Bureau of Prisons spokeswoman in Washington, Traci Billingsley, said that intrusive searches are performed ''extremely rarely'' in the penal system.)   Isolation Cell No. 1 measured 10 feet by 10 feet. At its center was a concrete bunk. The only other furnishings were a plastic chair and a metal toilet. Now dressed in an orange jumpsuit, Omar desperately needed to use the bathroom but was still shackled. ''Can you take these off?'' he asked. The answer was no. ''But how am I going to --?'' The question was cut off by a corrections officer who motioned for another guard to join him. Each grabbed one of Omar's elbows and steered him to the bowl. But with the handcuffs still on, he could barely manage his zipper, much less aim. Urine began running down his pant leg as, he maintains, the guards laughed.   Warden Carl Casterline came to visit him the next morning. ''He said he had orders from Washington to keep me there until further notice,'' Omar says. Omar again asked to telephone an attorney but says his request was denied. The warden was polite but firm on the matter; he had instructions from D.C., he said. The warden asked if he any special dietary needs. ''I don't eat pork,'' Omar said. Lunch was brought to him soon after. It consisted, he says, of bologna and ham. The lawsuit contends that the warden deprived Omar of his right to a religious diet.   Casterline's office declined to comment on any aspect of this account, referring queries to the Bureau of Prisons in Washington. Billingsley, the B.O.P. spokeswoman, said she could not speak to Omar's case specifically but explained that federal policy allows inmates access to telephones for up to 300 minutes a month, provides alternative religious diets and mandates that prisoners be given exercise periods outside their cells.   Omar decided to go on a hunger strike until he was allowed to call counsel. The guards were unmoved. ''One of them said, 'The attorney general just signed a new law today,''' Omar remembers. ''We can keep you here as long as we like.'''   For the next 10 days, Omar was not allowed out of his cell. ''I thought I had died and this was hell.'' He kept having recurring dreams that his mother and little brother in Egypt were dead and that he was holding his daughter, Jasmine. He would wake crying and hide under his blanket so that the guards did not see.   The F.B.I. returned a few days later with a consent form they wanted him to sign allowing the search of a crate of sample antiques he had received from Cairo. He signed the papers, he says, and again asked for a lawyer.   By the time the attorney Candy had hired to find her husband, Lawrence Fabacher, finally reached his client, it was too late to prepare for Omar's immigration hearing, which had been scheduled for Oct. 2. The hearing was pushed back two weeks.   ''I tried to sleep as much as possible to make the time go faster,'' Omar recalls. He did push-ups and sit-ups to keep fit, but his cell was so cold that he got the chills whenever he broke a sweat. They had turned off the hot water to his shower, so he stopped bathing. Pork was served at least twice a day.   He had a newfound desire to practice his religion and tried to guess the correct hours for prayers by following the changing of the guards. They would congregate outside his cell and make faces whenever he tried to pray.   On Oct. 16, two days before his I.N.S. hearing, two F.B.I. agents appeared. Omar recognized one as the polygraph technician from Little Rock. They wanted to know about his financial affairs; around that time, the hunt for Al Qaeda had shifted to tracing the money trail. For more than four hours, they pored over his banking and credit-card statements. Omar was questioned about every deposit, withdrawal and major purchase he had made since coming to America and asked about the nature of the antiques business he wanted to start.   Again, he was shown photographs of the hijackers and of Osama bin Laden and asked if he recognized any of them. ''Sure,'' Omar said, pointing to bin Laden. The agents pounced: Where do you know him from? Television, Omar answered.   He submitted to another lie-detector test, similar to the one he'd taken in Fort Smith, except that it now included questions about whether he had ever lied on I.N.S. application forms and if he was currently married to Candy.   The results of the test apparently were not conclusive. The exam was re-administered, with the same result. We have to send for a specialist, the technician said.   The specialist arrived from Houston the following day, lugging a digital polygraph machine that was hooked up to a laptop computer. Omar, by this time, could recite the questions by rote. But the F.B.I. was still not satisfied. One answer in particular kept coming up as inconclusive. And it happened to be the most important one: shown a picture of the hijackers, he was asked if he knew any of them.   ''The specialist from Houston freaked out,'' Omar recalls. ''He leaned in so close that his nose was almost touching mine. You know somebody, he shouted. No, I yelled back. Yes, he screamed. I can see your mind on my computer screen.''   Eventually everyone simmered down. ''We can help you,'' Omar remembers the specialist saying, ''if you help us. We can get you a new identity. We can get you money. You know there's a $25 million reward for Osama's capture. We can move you anyplace and protect Jasmine and Candy.''   The next morning, Omar's immigration hearing went surprisingly well. The judge seemed sympathetic and ordered him released on the relatively low bond of $5,000. ''I was so excited,'' Omar recalls. He says he ate his first complete meal in days and cleaned his cell. He could barely sleep that night and woke early. Candy would be coming to collect him at the opening of business hours. He sat expectantly on his bunk, his few belongings in a neat pile. The hours passed: 9, noon, 3 in the afternoon, then 4 and, finally, 5. At 6, he called a prison administrator. The I.N.S. prosecutor had appealed his bond. Under the new antiterror measures, the government could overturn judges' decisions in ''special-interest cases.''   Even today, Omar gets emotional when describing how he felt when he heard the news. He stopped eating. For 68 hours, he didn't touch food or drink, until, he says, they threatened to put tubes up his nose. ''It was like part of me just died,'' he remembers.   Omar was in a near-catatonic state. He couldn't tell the difference between day and night, weekdays and weekends any longer. As the weeks passed, his depression grew deeper. He lost 20 pounds. A second closed immigration hearing in mid-November did not go well. The judge was apologetic but said there was nothing he could do; the government had made the call.   Omar now hardly moved from his concrete bunk. His feet grew swollen from inactivity. ''I thought I would have to stay in that room forever,'' he recalls. He couldn't take it any longer. He decided to kill himself -- and to make this intention known.   Suddenly, everyone seemed very concerned. The warden visited and sent a psychiatrist. The F.B.I. man came and kept asking if he was serious about suicide. They could probably tell he had reached the end of his rope. And maybe, in the end, that was what saved him.   t's impossible to say precisely why the authorities finally decided that Omar must be telling the truth. One senior law enforcement official in Washington did, however, agree to share a theory, on the condition that neither his name nor the agency he works for be revealed.   ''If your subject has a complete breakdown,'' he said, ''the barriers to resistance are lessened. Once a person is at that point, he has lost the will to deceive, and you can be pretty certain that he's not lying.''   Omar had apparently passed his final test. Is he innocent? It is, of course, impossible to know, just as it is impossible to frame the question. Innocent of what? Charges were never presented. Perhaps the most important indication of his innocence is that for 73 days the government could find nothing beyond its original suspicions to hold him on. On Nov. 20, he was told to get his things together. ''Do you want to go home?'' a cheerful I.N.S. official asked. Three days later he was with Candy, on the freeway driving to Arkansas to see Jasmine.   The ordeal, however, is not entirely over. The couple is broke; they have been forced to sell their car and furniture and move in with Candy's father, a postal worker. Many of their friends have deserted them. Employment prospects for Omar are bleak: he was fired by his pre-9/11 employer, and the only work he can find now is volunteering for a charity for disadvantaged children. And the government, citing Omar's first marriage, which it says was a sham (a charge Omar denies), has continued deportation proceedings against him. They just want him out of here, for reasons they still will not explain.     Matthew Brzezinski is a contributing writer for the magazine.

How to Build an H-Bomb Making and owning an H-bomb is the kind of challenge real Americans seek. Who wants to be a passive victim of nuclear war when, with a little effort, you can be an active participant? Bomb shelters are for losers. Who wants to huddle together underground eating canned Spam? Winners want to push the button themselves. Making your own H-bomb is a big step in nuclear assertiveness training -- it's called Taking Charge. We're sure you'll enjoy the risks and the heady thrill of playing nuclear chicken. Introduction When the Feds clamped down on The Progressive magazine for attempting to publish an article on the manufacture of the hydrogen bomb, it piqued our curiosity. Was it really true that atomic and hydrogen bomb technology was so simple you could build an H-bomb in your own kitchen? Seven Days decided to find out. Food editor Barbara Ehrenreich, investigative reporter Peter Biskind, Photographer Jane Melnick and nuclear scientist Michio Kaku were given three days to cook up a workable H-bomb. They did and we have decided to share their culinary secrets with you. Not that Seven Days supports nuclear terrorism. We don't. We would prefer to die slowly from familiar poisons like low-level radiation, microwaves, DDT, DBCP, aflatoxins, PBBs, PBCs, or food dyes, rather than unexpectedly, say as hostage to a Latvian nationalist brandishing a homemade bomb. In our view the real terrorists are the governments, American, Soviet, French, Chinese, and British, that are hoarding H-bombs for their own use, and worse still, those governments (U.S., French and German) that are eagerly peddling advanced nuclear technology to countries like South Africa, Brazil, and Argentina so that they can make their own bombs. When these bombs are used, and they will be, it will be the world's big-time nuclear peddlers, along with corporate suppliers like General Electric, Westinghouse, and Gulf Oil, that we can thank for it. Gagging The Progressive will do no more for national security than backyard bomb shelters because like it or not the news is out. The heart of the successful H-bomb is the successful A-bomb. Once you've got your A-bombs made the rest is frosting on the cake. All you have to do is set them up so that when they detonate they'll start off a hydrogen-fusion reaction.  Part 1: Making Your Bomb Step 1: Getting the Ingredients Uranium is the basic ingredient of the A-bomb. When a uranium atom's nucleus splits apart, it releases a tremendous amount of energy (for its size), and it emits neutrons which go on to split other nearby uranium nuclei, releasing more energy, in what is called a 'chain reaction'. (When atoms split, matter is converted into energy according to Einstein's equation E=MC2. What better way to mark his birthday than with your own atomic fireworks?) There are two kinds (isotopes) of uranium: the rare U-235, used in bombs, and the more common, heavier, but useless U-238. Natural uranium contains less than 1 percent U-235 and in order to be usable in bombs it has to be 'enriched' to 90 percent U-235 and only 10 percent U-238. Plutonium-239 can also be used in bombs as a substitute for U-235. Ten pounds of U-235 (or slightly less plutonium) is all that is necessary for a bomb. Less than ten pounds won't give you a critical mass. So purifying or enriching naturally occurring uranium is likely to be your first big hurdle. It is infinitely easy to steal ready-to-use enriched uranium or plutonium than to enrich some yourself. And stealing uranium is not as hard as it sounds. There are at least three sources of enriched uranium or plutonium... Enriched uranium is manufactured at a gaseous diffusion plant in Portsmouth, Ohio. From there it is shipped in 10 liter bottles by airplane and trucks to conversion plants that turn it into uranium oxide or uranium metal. Each 10 liter bottle contains 7 kilograms of U-235, and there are 20 bottles to a typical shipment. Conversion facilities exist at Hematite, Missouri; Apollo, Pennsylvania; and Erwin, Tennessee. The Kerr-McGee plant at Crescent Oklahoma -- where Karen Silkwood worked -- was a conversion plant that 'lost' 40 lbs of plutonium. Enriched uranium can be stolen from these plants or from fuel-fabricating plants like those in New Haven, San Diego; or Lynchburg, Virginia. (A former Kerr-McGee supervisor, James V. Smith, when asked at the Silkwood trial if there were any security precautions at the plant to prevent theft, testified that 'There were none of any kind, no guards, no fences, no nothing.') Plutonium can be obtained from places like United Nuclear in Pawling, New York; Nuclear Fuel Services in Erwin, Tennessee; General Electric in Pleasanton, California; Westinghouse in Cheswick, Pennsylvania; Nuclear Materials and Equipment Corporation (NUMEC) in Leechburg, Pennsylvania; and plants in Hanfford, Washington and Morris, Illinois. According to Rolling Stone magazine the Israelis were involved in the theft of plutonium from NUMEC. Finally you can steal enriched uranium or plutonium while it's en-route from conversion plants to fuel fabricating plants. It is usually transported (by air or truck) in the form of uranium oxide, a brownish powder resembling instant coffee, or as a metal, coming in small chunks called 'broken buttons.' Both forms are shipped in small cans stacked in 5-inch cylinders braced with welded struts in the center of ordinary 55 gallon steel drums. The drums weigh about 100 pounds and are clearly marked 'Fissible Material' or 'Danger, Plutonium.' A typical shipment might go from the enrichment plant at Portsmouth, Ohio to the conversion plant in Hematite Missouri then to Kansas City by truck where it would be flown to Los Angeles and then trucked down to the General Atomic plant in San Diego. The plans for the General Atomic plant are on file at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's reading room at 1717 H Street NW Washington. A Xerox machine is provided for the convenience of the public. If you can't get hold of any enriched uranium you'll have to settle for commercial grade (20 percent U-235). This can be stolen from university reactors of a type called TRIGA Mark II, where security is even more casual than at commercial plants. If stealing uranium seems too tacky you can buy it. Unenriched uranium is available at any chemical supply house for $23 a pound. Commercial grade (3 to 20 percent enriched) is available for $40 a pound from Gulf Atomic. You'll have to enrich it further yourself. Quite frankly this can be something of a pain in the ass. You'll need to start with a little more than 50 pounds of commercial-grade uranium. (It's only 20 percent U-235 at best, and you need 10 pounds of U-235 so... ) But with a little kitchen-table chemistry you'll be able to convert the solid uranium oxide you've purchased into a liquid form. Once you've done that, you'll be able to separate the U-235 that you'll need from the U-238. First pour a few gallons of concentrated hydrofluoric acid into your uranium oxide, converting it to uranium tetrafluoride. (Safety note: Concentrated hydrofluoric acid is so corrosive that it will eat its way through glass, so store it only in plastic. Used 1-gallon plastic milk containers will do.) Now you have to convert your uranium tetrafluoride to uranium hexafluoride, the gaseous form of uranium, which is convenient for separating out the isotope U-235 from U-238. To get the hexafluoride form, bubble fluorine gas into your container of uranium tetrafluoride. Fluorine is available in pressurized tanks from chemical-supply firms. Be careful how you use it though because fluorine is several times more deadly than chlorine, the classic World War I poison gas. Chemists recommend that you carry out this step under a stove hood (the kind used to remove unpleasant cooking odors). If you've done your chemistry right you should now have a generous supply of uranium hexafluoride ready for enriching. In the old horse-and-buggy days of A-bomb manufacture the enrichment was carried out by passing the uranium hexafluoride through hundreds of miles of pipes, tubes, and membranes, until the U-235 was eventually separated from the U-238. This gaseous-diffusion process, as it was called is difficult, time-consuming, and expensive. Gaseous-diffusion plants cover hundreds of acres and cost in the neighborhood of $2-billion each. So forget it. There are easier, and cheaper, ways to enrich your uranium. First transform the gas into a liquid by subjecting it to pressure. You can use a bicycle pump for this. Then make a simple home centrifuge. Fill a standard-size bucket one-quarter full of liquid uranium hexafluoride. Attach a six-foot rope to the bucket handle. Now swing the rope (and attached bucket) around your head as fast as possible. Keep this up for about 45 minutes. Slow down gradually, and very gently put the bucket on the floor. The U-235, which is lighter, will have risen to the top, where it can be skimmed off like cream. Repeat this step until you have the required 10 pounds of uranium. (Safety note: Don't put all your enriched uranium hexafluoride in one bucket. Use at least two or three buckets and keep them in separate corners of the room. This will prevent the premature build-up of a critical mass.) Now it's time to convert your enriched uranium back to metal form. This is easily enough accomplished by spooning several ladlefuls of calcium (available in tablet form from your drugstore) into each bucket of uranium. The calcium will react with the uranium hexafluoride to produce calcium fluoride, a colorless salt which can be easily be separated from your pure enriched uranium metal. A few precautions: • While uranium is not dangerously radioactive in the amounts you'll be handling, if you plan to make more than one bomb it might be wise to wear gloves and a lead apron, the kind you can buy in dental supply stores. • Plutonium is one of the most toxic substances known. If inhaled, a thousandth of a gram can cause massive fibrosis of the lungs, a painful way to go. Even a millionth of a gram in the lungs will cause cancer. If eaten plutonium is metabolized like calcium. It goes straight to the bones where it gives out alpha particles preventing bone marrow from manufacturing red blood cells. The best way to avoid inhaling plutonium is to hold your breath while handling it. If this is too difficult wear a mask. To avoid ingesting plutonium orally follow this simple rule: never make an A-bomb on an empty stomach. • If you find yourself dozing off while you're working, or if you begin to glow in the dark, it might be wise to take a blood count. Prick your finger with a sterile pin, place a drop of blood on a microscope slide, cover it with a cover slip, and examine under a microscope. (Best results are obtained in the early morning.) When you get leukemia, immature cells are released into the bloodstream, and usually the number of white cells increases (though this increase might take almost 2 weeks). Red blood cells look kind of like donuts (without the hole), and are slightly smaller than the white cells, each of which has a nucleus. Immature red cells look similar to white cells (i.e.. slightly larger and have a nucleus). If you have more than about 1 white cell (including immature ones) to 400 red cells then start to worry. But, depending upon your plans for the eventual use of the bomb, a short life expectancy might not be a problem.  Step 2: Assembling the A-Bomb Now that you've acquired the enriched uranium, all that's left is to assemble your A-bomb. Go find a couple of stainless steel salad bowls. You also want to separate your 10 pounds of U-235 into two hunks. (Keep them apart!) The idea is to push each half your uranium into the inside of a bowl. Take one hunk of your uranium and beat it into the inside of the first bowl. Uranium is malleable, like gold, so you should have no trouble hammering it into the bowl to get a good fit. Take another five-pound hunk of uranium and fit it into a second stainless steel bowl. These two bowls of U-235 are the 'subcritical masses' which, when brought together forcefully, will provide the critical mass that makes your A-bomb go. Keep them a respectful distance apart while working because you don't want them to 'go critical' on you... At least not yet. Now hollow out the body of an old vacuum cleaner and place your two hemispherical bowls inside, open ends facing each other, no less than seven inches apart, using masking tape to set them up in position. The reason for the steel bowls and the vacuum cleaner, in case you're wondering, is that these help reflect the neutrons back into the uranium for a more efficient explosion. 'A loose neutron is a useless neutron' as the A-bomb pioneers used to say. As far as the A-bomb goes, you're almost done. The final problem is to figure out how to get the two U-235 hemispheres to smash into each other with sufficient force to set off a truly effective fission reaction. Almost any type of explosive can be used to drive them together. Gunpowder, for example, is easily made at home from potassium nitrate, sulfur, and carbon. Or, you can get some blasting caps or TNT. (Buy them or steal them from a construction site.) Best of all is C4 plastic explosive. You can mold it around your bowls, and it's fairly safe to work with. (But, it might be wise to shape it around an extra salad bowl in another room, and THEN fit it to your uranium-packed bowls. This is particularly true in winter, when a stray static electrical charge might induce ignition in the C4. A responsible bomb maker considers it impolite to accidentally destroy more of the neighborhood than absolutely necessary.) Once the explosives are in place all you need to do is hook up a simple detonation device with a few batteries, a switch, and some wire. Remember though that it is essential that the two charges -- one on each side of the casing -- go off simultaneously. Now put the whole thing in the casing of an old Hoover vacuum cleaner and you're finished with this part of the process. The rest is easy.  Step 3: Make More A-Bombs Following the Directions Above  A Word to the Wise About Wastes After your A-bomb is completed you'll have a pile of moderately fatal radioactive wastes like U-238. These are not dangerous, but you do have to get rid of them. You can flush leftovers down the toilet. (Don't worry about polluting the ocean, there is already so much radioactive waste there, a few more bucketfuls won't make any waves whatsoever.) If you're the fastidious type -- the kind who never leaves gum under their seat at the movies -- you can seal the nasty stuff in coffee cans and bury it in the backyard, just like Uncle Sam does. If the neighbor kids have a habit of trampling the lawn, tell them to play over by the waste. You'll soon find that they're spending most of their time in bed.  Going First Class If you're like us, you're feeling the economic pinch, and you'll want to make your bomb as inexpensively as possible, consonant of course with reasonable yield. The recipe we've given is for a budget-pleasing H-bomb, no frills, no flourishes; it's just a simple 5-megaton bomb, capable of wiping out the New York metropolitan area, the San Francisco Bay area, or Boston. But don't forget, your H-bomb will only be as good as the A-bombs in it. If you want to spend a little more money you can punch-up your A-bomb considerably. Instead of centrifuging your uranium by hand, you can buy a commercial centrifuge. (Fisher Scientific sells one for about $1000.) You also might want to be fussier about your design. The Hiroshima bomb, a relatively crude one, only fissioned 1 percent of it's uranium and yielded only 13 kilotons. In order to fission more of the uranium, the force of your explosive 'trigger' needs to be evenly diffused around the sphere; the same pressure has to be exerted on every point of the sphere simultaneously. (It was a technique for producing this sort of simultaneous detonation by fashioning the explosives into lenses that the government accused Julius and Ethel Rosenberg of trying to steal).  Part 2: Putting Your H-Bomb Together The heart of the H-bomb is the fusion process. Several A-bombs are detonated in such a way as to create the extremely high temperature (100 million degrees C) necessary to fuse lithium deuteride (LiD) into helium. When the lithium nucleus slams into the deuterium nucleus, two helium nuclei are created, and if this happens to enough deuterium nuclei rapidly enough, the result is an enormous amount of energy: the energy of the H-bomb. You don't have to worry about stealing lithium deuteride, it can be purchased from any chemical-supply house. It costs $1000 a pound. If your budget won't allow it you can substitute lithium hydride at $40 a pound. You will need at least 100 pounds. It's a corrosive and toxic powder so be careful. Place the lithium deuteride or hydride in glass jars and surround it with four A-bombs in their casings. Attach them to the same detonator so that they will go off simultaneously. The container for the whole thing is no problem. They can be placed anywhere: Inside an old stereo console, a discarded refrigerator, etc... When the detonator sets off the four A-bombs all eight hemispheres of fissionable material will slam into each other at the same time creating four critical masses and four detonations. This will raise the temperature of the lithium deuteride to 100 million degrees C fast enough (a few billionths of a second) so that the lithium will not be blown all over the neighborhood before the nuclei have time to fuse. The result, at least 1000 times the punch of the puny A-bomb that leveled Hiroshima (20 million tons of TNT vs. 20 thousand tons.)  Part 3: What to do With Your Bomb Now that you have a fully assembled H-bomb housed in an attractive console of your choice you may be wondering, 'What should I do with it?' Every family will have to answer this question according to its own tastes and preferences, but you may want to explore some possibilities which have been successfully pioneered by the American government. 1. Sell Your Bomb and Make a Pile of Money In these days of rising inflation, increasing unemployment, and an uncertain economic outlook, few businesses make as much sense as weapons production. If your career forecast is cloudy, bomb sales may be the only sure way to avoid the humiliation of receiving welfare, or unemployment. Regardless of your present income level, a home H-bomb business can be an invaluable income supplement, and certainly a profitable alternative to selling Tupperware or pirated Girl Scout cookies. Unfortunately for the family bomb business, big government has already cornered a large part of the world market. But this does not mean that there is a shortage of potential customers. The raid on Entebee was the Waterloo of hijacking, and many nationalist groups are now on the alert for new means to get their message across. They'd jump at the chance to get hold of an H-bomb. Emerging nations which can't ante up enough rice or sugar to buy themselves a reactor from G.E. or Westinghouse are also shopping around. You may wonder about the ethics of selling to nations, or groups, whose goals you may disapprove of. But here again, take a tip from our government: forget ideology -- it's cash that counts. And remember, H-bomb sales have a way of escalating, almost like a chain reaction. Suppose you make a sale to South Yemen which you believe to be a Soviet puppet. Well within a few days some discrete inquiries from North Yemen and possibly the Saudis, the Egyptians and the Ethiopians as well can be expected. Similarly, a sale to the IRA will generate a sale to the Ulster government; and a sale to the Tanzanians will bring the Ugandans running, and so forth. It doesn't matter WHICH side you're on, only how many sides there are. Don't forget about the possibility of repeat sales to the same customer. As the experience of both the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. has shown, each individual nation has a potentially infinite need for H-bombs. No customer -- no matter how small -- can ever have too many. 2. Use Your Bomb at Home Many families are attracted to the H-bomb simply as a 'deterrent.' A discrete sticker on the door or on the living room window saying 'This Home Protected by H-bomb' will discourage IRS investigators, census takers, and Jehovah's Witnesses. You'll be surprised how fast the crime rate will go down and property values will go up. And once the news gets out that you are a home H-bomb owner you'll find that you have unexpected leverage in neighborhood disputes over everything from parking places and stereo noise levels to school tax rates. So relax and enjoy the pride and excitement of home H-bomb ownership!  Is It For You? Let's be honest. The H-bomb isn't for everyone. Frankly there are people who can't handle it. They break out in hives at the very mention of mega-death, fallout, or radiation sickness. The following quiz will help you find out whether you have what it takes for home H-bomb ownership. If you can answer 'yes' to six or more of these questions, then you're emotionally eligible to join the nuclear club. If not, a more conventional weapon may be more your cup of tea, try botulism-toxin, laser rays, or nerve gas. 1. I ignore the demands of others. 2.

Myths About Nuclear War Ever since the first mushroom cloud over Hiroshima ushered in the atomic age, a small group of nay-sayers and doom-mongers has lobbied, campaigned and demonstrated to convince Americans that H-bomb ownership, along with nuclear power, is dangerous and unhealthy. Using their virtual stranglehold over the media, these people have tried to discredit everything nuclear from energy to war. They have vastly overrated the risks of nuclear bombs and left many Americans feeling demoralized and indecisive; not sure where the truth lies. Well, here are the myths, and here are the facts. Myth: After a nuclear exchange the earth will no longer be suitable for human habitation. Fact: This is completely false. According to one scientist (quoted in John McPee's The Curve of Binding Energy) 'The largest bomb that has ever been exploded anywhere was 60 megatons, and that is one-thousandth the force of an earthquake, one-thousandth the force of a hurricane. We have lived with earthquakes and hurricanes for a long time.' Another scientist adds, 'It is often assumed that a full blown nuclear war would be the end of life on earth. That is far from the truth. To end life on earth would take at least a thousand times the total yield of all the nuclear explosives existing in the world, and probably a lot more.' Even if humans succumbed, many forms of life would survive a nuclear free-for-all, cockroaches, certain forms of bacteria, and lichens, for instance. Myth: Radiation is bad for you. Fact: Everything is bad for you if you have too much of it. If you eat too many bananas you'll get a stomach-ache. If you get too much sun you can get sunburned (or even skin cancer). Same thing with radiation. Too much may make you feel under the weather, but nuclear industry officials insist that there is no evidence that low-level radiation has any really serious adverse effects. And, high-level radiation may bring unexpected benefits. It speeds up evolution by weeding out unwanted genetic types and creating new ones. (Remember the old saying, 'Two heads are better than one.') Nearer to home, it's plain that radiation will get rid of pesky crab grass and weeds, and teenagers will find that brief exposure to a nuclear burst vaporizes acne and other skin blemishes. (Many survivors of the Hiroshima bomb found that they were free from skin and it's attendant problems forever.) We hope this clears up any misconceptions you may have had. Enjoy your H-Bomb!           "

Ever since I was a young-in (and I saw Raiders of the Lost Ark) I wanted to head out to Egypt and check out some pyraminds, tse tse flies, and some delicious artifacts.  I used to actually read up on all of the ancient lore and I was convinced that I could find the lost ark of the covenenant.  Now that I'm older and a bit more agnostic, I'm not sure it ever exists.  But...it was fun while it lasted.   2. When someone asks your opinion about a new haircut/outfit/etc, are you always honest?   I'm a guy, so this doesn't happen too often.  Sometimes DJ Laura Z will ask my opinion (and yes, I get the 'is my butt too big in these?' question) but I'm usually pretty straightforward.  I guess I don't remember a time when anyone, Duf included, asked me what I thought of his pants or his haircut.  So, I guess my answer is: when applicable, yes.    3. Have you ever found out something about a friend and then wished you hadn't? What happened?   No, not really.   4. If you could live in any fictional world (from a book/movie/game/etc.) which would it be and why?   I know I sound like a total nerd, but I think it would be cool to be Neo from the Matrix and just kick all kinds of ass all the time, fly whenever you wanted to, love Carrie Anne Moss down, and hang out with Lawrence Fishburne.  Jesus...who wouldn't want that?     5. What's one talent/skill you don't have but always wanted?   There's two.  I always wanted to learn how to play an instrument.  I've got an acoustic guitar in my closet just dying for me to learn how to play it.  I also wish I had the ability to go without sleep for as long as I wanted.  As a busy 30 year old, I find I don't have enough time in each day to get my shit done, so I'd like to chip into my sleep-time hours, with no negative drawbacks and regain that 1/3 of my life that's just being wasted.

4082066,female,Consulting,"        on march 29th 2004 at 10  : 45 in the morning i was walking home from work. it was a beautiful spring day and i was looking forward to a walk through a big park near by for exercise . i was also taking my camera along in hopes of some cherry blossom shots. work had been uncomfortable but that day i rocked and was in a great mood. i was going over what i needed to gather to get going. there were a couple of cars waiting at the stop sign so i decided to walk a bit closer to my building before i crossed the street. i was almost across from the front door so i went to cross between two cars. they were parked close together so when i stepped down off the curb i stepped on the edge of a hole i didn't see. i  so  didn't expect that. i went down fast and hard. as it was happening i knew i had really messed up. the bag containing my cd player, some cd's, my journal and the small ceramic coffee cup i had just won as a prize went flying (and breaking) all over the street. It's a busy street so i tried in my pain amidst a string of profanity to retrieve my items. one attempt to move and i realized one of my worst fears had come true. the sole bread winner was down!   i have worked hard the last 3 years to be self sufficient. i have not gone out partying on the night before a early morning (early is 3:20am) at work. common sense i know but a lot of my co-workers do it regulary. i would resist buying that awesome pair of shoes that i would love to have but didn't need. i always made sure i had rent and bills covered before all else. Don't give me the sainthood quite yet. what i'm saying is there was nobody around to be my back up. (that's a whole set of stories i will eventually get to) i'm proud of the person i am and evolving into. i have always been and still am a responsible person. yea for me because i had paid the extra for health insurance. in the 1 1/2 years i worked there i never really needed it. some co-workers even had said i should cancel it so i would have extra spending money. i just felt better knowing if i needed it i had it. well i was gonna need it now!   the fire marshal was coming to do an inspection of the sprinkler system in my building. he was freaked out watching me go down and putting sailors everywhere to shame with my string of profanity at a increased volume . he gathered my items and helped me hop to my building. once inside i took it from there and got to my apt. my right knee was bleeding pretty good and i had to get my shoe and sock off while i still could. i was in a lot of pain so i allowed myself a few minutes of crying then i called work to ask if the next person to get off would take me...... wait... where  do  i go? i had no clue since i never had an emergency! i had to play corporate phone transfer til one lady told me my options. that burned up most of the hour i spent waiting for jasmine to show up.    she was new at my store and to portland so i didn't really know her very well. she used the spare keys i kept in my locker to get in my place. she got me advil and cleaned my knee up. she even helped me change out of my uniform! she and her husband drove me cross town to my doctors office. i told them they didn't have to wait for me. i was being fit in so who knew how long i would be. sara, my friend who lived next door, worked over that way and would be getting off about the time i'd probably be done.   the doctor asked me more than once ' how did you do this again?' after an exam and x-ray it was determined that i had severely sprained my ankle and had to stay off it for sometime. ouch.

4192173,male,Technology,"             Upon finishing the post below, something was nagging at me. Like I had forgotten something. And then it hit me.  Besides this week being the 10th anniversary of the first time Mark Mothasemi and I took to the stage with the teenage versions of Ash and Tom, a year ago this past weekend, the aggression played what will be most likely be their last ever show. From what I recall, it was a good gig, though honestly, we were always good (though we got REALLY good once Robin came in). We played here in the City and the other band no showed, so we were able to do our extended set without having to cut anything. it was sparsely attended, especially in comparison to our previous NYC shows, but it was hastily put together and we had just come back from Russia when the opportunity to play arose. While we had several gigs over the past 10 years that were supposed to be our last, the one time I didn't think was the last one, was in fact, THE LAST GIG EVER (TM). I've not seen a video of this gig because, according to Matt Gentile, the tape is 'fucked up'. I nag him occasionally about this, but there's a romanticism to never seeing it  I always felt like the aggression should have gone out like the end of Michael Mann's HEAT, in an overblown blaze of glory. That gig has been played over and over in my head millions of times. From what I would wear to what I would play, the gig was preconceived for the past few years. I don't think I was alone in that as I recall Ash having a set list for such a gig (as well as several drafted letters of resignation).  I was about to share with you my thoughts on what that gig should be. I've decided against it as I think what you are speculating might be better than what I had planned.   I thought I would be more emotional about it, but I guess I got over it more quickly than I anticipated. This could be because I remain in such close,  daily, contact with the people who did matter and worked hard to make the aggression something special. Another reason, and I can see this with time having passed, I was fucking miserable in the band thanks to the lack of focus and maturity within it. But if I am anything, I am loyal and I was the general who took the ship down to a noble death.  Let's be frank, we only sold a few thousand records, we were never even a blip on a radar. However, for ten years it was the world I and a few others lived in and while I can never forgive the few who tried to fuck with it,  I love that the music and the experiences will be something no one can ever take away or tarnish. I wanted to save the industrial scene when bands i adored like Chemlab and Skinny Puppy went away. With all of these old schoolers coming back and putting out records, I can rest easier knowing we kept our elders seats warm in their absence.   From the pits of the Underworld to the former Soviet Union, the casualty rate was shockingly low and most of the friendships remain intact. Plus, some records came out that I love to pieces. They proudly hang on my well as reminders of the wonderful life I have led for 10 years.  And don't think I don't seen the irony in the fact that the one of last songs the aggression ever played was in fact, Hypefactor's SWEETEST SOUL.  HAH.  F         "
2844168,female,Marketing,"                 I love Saturdays! Ked worked on some freelance jobs off and on all day long, and I just hung around. I have these days every now and then when I'm restless. Nothing sounds interesting to do and so I flit from activity to activity not really accomplishing anything nor having the mental focus to accomplish anything if I tried. Today was one of those days!  Jason called last night and it was good to catch up with him. Ked and I continually count our blessings when it comes to our siblings and their other halves. It's one thing to have good relationships with all our siblings. It's quite another thing to consider them  great friends  and people we want to hang out with and live our lives with. We are truly blessed.  Speaking of blessed with good friendships, the Falcon has given me the code name of Gladriel on his blog (nxgnn8). He says we should all understand where our code names came from, but this is a complete mystery to me. The thought of being a tall, slender, blonde elf is quite appealing though! Or maybe he chose it realizing what a graceful and qualified leader I am. HA!! Anywho, we are continually thankful for the friendship there, as well as with all our friends across the country. It's most delightful to look over the map of our lives and recognize that were it not for a pitt stop or a detour here and there we might not have some of the most precious friendships in our lives. It may be through a chance meeting (like Chancel camp freshman year at CU, I miss you Jennifer!), or through the friendship of our parents and their common hobbies (where are you Karen, I miss you too!), or a lifetime bond begun in kindergarten Sunday School (I can't wait to see you in July, Shelley!), but there is no doubt that the golden threads of friendship woven into my life enrich the beauty of life on this earth. No matter the time and distance that separates us, you are precious gems.  In blogging news, Ked helped me add a comments section to my blog! You can now post a reply, comment or thought to my posts! So, we are still looking for ideas for a tv show to produce for Public Access (see my previous post). If you have any suggestions, post a reply! Ked's coworker Brian thought we could do a David Blaine spoof. With Ked growing his hair out long, Brian says Ked looks like a magician and thought we could go around the University campus and do magic tricks. Oh my.               "
883178,male,Fashion,"           Hal, that's funny you bring up that important topic.  T and I went to my  urlLink new favorite neighborhood bar  last Saturday.  Since I had spent the whole day on a boat, steadily drinking, I vowed to T that I would only have a salad and Diet Coke and we would just 'hang out.'  I did order my salad and DC, and we were just hanging out, until some guys came over to talk with us, one of them strikingly resembling Prince William. (Of course, I had to tell him that fact.  At first he thought I was talking about Prince Charles...'No!  The hot son of the late Princess Diana, you fool!')    All of a sudden I had the urge to order a round of shots for everyone.  Must be something about royalty and alcohol.  It's like a drug for me.    The night only got messy after this.  We ended up stopping by a sex shop, and we learned the lesson that it's illegal for women to go to 'the back of the store' - where the peep shows are.  For some reason, that seems ass-backwards to me.  Then, when we got to Monsignor Murphy's, one of the guys we were with decides to perform his own  urlLink 'Puppetry of the Penis'  (the ancient art of genital origami) show for a bunch of 40-something women.  Nothing like mixing tequila with penis tricks.  And his fiance thought it was a riot.  Hal, you have to move to Chicago, if only for the stories.

1708471,female,indUnk,"           17 is a weird age. You don't feel much older but when you say you're 17 compared to 16 there's a big difference. 17 you're more mature you know how to handle situations better and you've become more responsible. But at the same time you get like no new privileges by law when you turn 17 making you still feel like you're just a kid. Although I notice no difference, I still like being 17.   My birthday didn't feel so much like a birthday, but I think half of that is because I've been doing stuff and 'partying' like every single day this summer. It did have some more special aspects though so it's all good. Thanks to everyone who did something special.

Now that that's out of the way...  Realization Number 1: While walking through the sun-drenched streets of South Beach on my lunch break, just barely breaking a sweat in the balmy 68 degrees (are you jealous yet?), I realized that no matter how tough life can be, I always carry a little bit of joy in me.  Realization Number 2: The art to a sexy walk is never looking like you're in a hurry.  You may very well be in a hurry, but your walk should not indicate this.  As long as, with every step, you feel the stride and enjoy the sound of your heel on the pavement, and move into the next long stride, you will be sexy.  Damnit.   Realization Number 3: Weird, misguided thought number 1: While making my way back from my lunch break walk, a man on the street sneezed really loud.  REALLY LOUD.  Echoing through the streets and alleys loud.  Everyone stopped in their tracks to look.  He moved on, and then sneezed again a moment later.  Twisted thought crossed my mind: Is he that loud in bed?  Then my mind meandered to last night, when I heard my neighbors from what must have been a kitchen romp.  Deep throaty moans with an even amount of time between each of them.  At the time, I just wanted to get my little diva into our apartment so I wouldn't have to explain the sounds coming from behind the other door.  But, today my mind wandered back to the sounds.

Went to Conchas Lake and did some fishing for a few days, and caught a whopping 2 perch that could have been twins.  Make that triplets, because my oldest son and my nephew caught the third one right on the surface with our net.  My 2 year old caught his first fish(with some help from dad and his cousin), a baby catfish that, even though it was a baby, outweighed both my perch put together.  And I did have a pretty good sized bass that I at least got to the surface before he spit the hook out, and he went one way and the hook and worm went the other way.  Oh well, had fun and family time, and that is really what it was all about.  And not catching any fish meant I didn't have to clean any fish, which is always a good thing.  Anyway, and this is totally unsolicited, if you ever go to Conchas, I highly recommend you stay at Adobe Lodge.

My job is to ensure that all people who enjoy viewing such a sport get the opportunity to do so in the right environment.  Namely, with me and about anyone else I can scrap together in this God-forsaken state (damn FIBs).         Seriously, since moving here I've trekked my ass every Sunday to the Alumni Club on Division for the games.  It's a Bear hang-out, but the owner is from Wisco and plays Green Bay upstairs with the Bears downstairs.  It isn't exactly the classiest bar in Chicago, but the beer is cheap, and I routinely get hammered and throw things.  I've got a few people who are always there with me, and there are always a bunch of people from Wisco who will seem somewhat familiar to me since I got drunk with them 16 Sundays last year.         Drop me an e-mail if you want, or just show up (by the way, I'm the guy from Guthrie's).  There are many things for us to be proud of, being from Wisconsin, and none less than our ability to cheer for Green Bay in a victory, or cloud our brain so heavily with beer that we forget about the loss.'   If my memory serves me right, he was the guy I took a picture with who kept making a 'W' gang-type sign with his hand and was incessantly yelling out 'go Wisco!'.  I'll be the first to admit that Packer fans are obnoxious.  Let's hope Lee Jeans can keep up with me and my family when we're all at Lambeau this Sunday.  He has no idea what he's in for, poor thing.          "
1103575,female,indUnk,"       I went shopping today.  :-)  I bought two dresses, on sale.  heehee, its kinda funny, they're completely different.  One's like fire engine red, and comes just past my knees, sort of retro 50's-ish I guess, and the other one is white and has a huge full skirt of layered tulle, like a cloud.  Its really pretty.  I love trying on formal dresses.  They make me feel pretty.  like Maria...  {... I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty, and witty, and bright! and I pity, yes I pity, any girl who isn't me tonight...    sad, that I can type those from memory isn't it?}  anyway...  and I went to visit Rebecca and gave her her birthday present finally...  her birthday is in September. lol.  Tomorrow I'm driving to Rolla... I want to stay home and talk to my friends... well, everybody's leaving tomorrow too, oh well.  .:sigh:.   Last night, I had the most fun sitting in my room by myself I think I've ever had. {wow, that makes me sound like a pathetic loser doesn't it?}   I was on the phone with Samantha and Chantele... wow, I had forgotten how much fun we have when the three of us are together.  and I had forgotten how incredibly insane Chantele is.  We were joking around about her boyfriend Ben's evil laugh {which is incredibly scary}  so she calls him on her cell phone, and sticks it up next to the other phone and makes him do it over the phone...   Its even scarier that way.  lol.       "

3581210,male,InvestmentBanking,"             Being gay in Korea is like being gay in the U.S. military...in 1950. Let's just say that it's not near as lovingly embraced as in the West/US. Gays marrying in Korea? C'mon! There are no Korean gays! Of course, if one is gay one can hardly be Korean. I'm not trying to piss of PCers out there, this is just the way many Koreans (especially men and older ones) think. Although the younger generation are more open to other ideas, it's the older generation that controls politics, education, finance, and even media and culture to a large degree. The CEOs of the TV stations are all men and all old guys, as an example.  Things are changing, though, as evidenced in this poster for a gay bar in Itaewon. (Now that you know its name you can either (i) know where to go or (ii) know where to avoid depending on your preference.)   urlLink     Yikes!   Here are a few websites on gays in Korea:  urlLink here  and  urlLink here .  urlLink This blog  has a tongue-in-cheek explanation of what being gay is...basically a primer in ' urlLink gaydar ' (how to recognize a gay in Korea or elsewhere). However, I think that many of the guys here have gay characteristics. It's pretty weird sometimes. In a business meeting one guy from a partner firm put his hand on my leg (just above the knee) as he spoke of my experience in finance and what I do for the investment process. This would be outrightly gay, but in Korea it's ok...it just shows (non-sexual) fondness and a measure of trust between two people. My boss does it also...much to the surprise of foreigners in our group...but, again, it's not 'gay' its just the culture here. My wife's uncle holds my hand, too...and not for 2-3 seconds; for 2-3 minutes. At first I thought it was pretty weird, but it just means that he really likes me. (Having said all this I know I'll have to put up with a deluge of gay jokes when I see my buds back in Canada, crap.)  Over here guys touch guys and girls touch girls, but it's just not sexual. Many young gals (especially) can be seen holding hands while walking down the road. Add to that the schoolgirl uniform and you have a formula for stimulation for most Western guys. You get used to it, though.  I really wonder about some of these Korean guys, though.  urlLink The Face Shop  has a model on all of their (make-up) stores that's pretty gay looking. There are others as well. These guys are (I hope) more  urlLink metrosexual  than homosexual, although the distinction is greying. Many of the boy bands have similar dudes in them-the clothes, the hair, the dance moves. I got to really wonder sometimes. (Remember  urlLink this guy? )  Perhaps because of the stigma attached to being gay in Korea most gays don't come out of the closet--choosing instead to marry, have kids and be a 'normal' person or going into singing or acting or modeling and making the excuse that they're too busy with their career to find a wife. Either way, it's quite different from in the West where there is more acceptance of such things.  On another topic: yesterday I had lunch with my CEO/boss and he mentioned that China and Korea were having a  urlLink tiff about the Gorguyeo Dynasty . He said, 'oh, how can you know about that...it is just Korean history'. Well, when I said that is was about 50AD-600AD and was concurrent with the Paekche and Shilla empires and before the United Shilla dynasty that preceded the closely-named Koryo Dynasty of about 1100-1300AD that was right before the venerated Chosun Dynasty of 1392-1910 he just looked at me. Not sure if he got all of what I said, but a colleague dining with us said that I do, in fact, know about Korean history...hey, I've been here almost 2 years-and not all of it has been in the bars. My dates of Koryo are a little off, but if you want more information of where Korea came from take a look at  urlLink this site . It has a cool timeline...just right if you're writing a report! So, if you're speaking with a Korean don't be surprised if they assume that since you're a foreigner you  can't  know precisely anything about Korea--and if you do know some facts or stories from its history you can really impress them well here.  Oh, and just for the record:  I'm not gay.          "
589736,male,Technology,"           Hi, y'all. Just read the postings from the 21st & have to say thanks for the props, and (after 'Nice to meet you, Angie lass') DO WHAT YOU LOVE OR LOVE WHAT YOU DO. It took me five years in Richmond, miserable and aimless, aware of something missing that I could never identify, to get where I am.   Think on it now. You may still have plenty of time, but it will fly by. Decide what you want and go get it, girl. I know that you can do it.   It's smart to have a fall-back field, but unless you make your dreams a priority they'll become your second choice. So don't forget the training for your chosen path (as well as the practical path), and start laying plans now to meet your goals.  And Mir, I don't know CUNY law school but I do have a friend in Columbia law school (an NYU master's in poetry who's becoming a lawyer to please his traditional Chinese parents). But enough about subverted intentions.         "

You will need the following software installed on your system.    Avidemux2   mplayer (for the mplex program)   dvdauthor   dvdrecord   mkisofs    urlLink this script    chmod +x dvdcreate.sh  Now lets get onto the business of creating a dvd.     Open the mpeg with avidemux2. Edit the file the way you want and save it as DVD-PS, using whatever file name you prefer IE... mymovie.mpg   Now use the dvdcreate.sh script like....   sh /path/to/script/dvdcreate.sh  /path/to/mpeg/mymovie.mpg /path/to/mymovie  (this last part is created when the script is run, but you still have to give it a path and name)  That is all on line. Replace  /path/to/...  with your respective paths. Notice that the last part has no extention, it is a directory that contains the dvd video structure.    mkisofs -v -dvd-video -udf /path/to/mymovie > /path/to/mymovie.iso    dvdrecord -v -eject -dao -pad -data driveropts=burnfree dev=0,1,0  (replace with your acual device)  mymovie.iso    After the burn is complete you should now have a dvd that playes on most any dvd player.

1415200,female,Student,"         Forget me. It's that simple.   You say hate is such a strong word. And yet. I use it most often.  Coming from an agnostic person, I hope you should take my theory to heart. As Ive seen more sorrow than you religious pukes will ever. I see the normal human being. They belive what they've been taught from the start of their time. God Created them. And things are fine..as long as you have absolution. Others, who are agnostic, were (most likley) not grown up on religion. We just know that we are here, and we can do what we want with it. And thats life.  Well, sitting there the other day, I realized how sad I was, and all the while I was thinking, 'I bet the kid who prays before bed, has never been as down as this, and I bet he will never know what the end is like before it actually happens.' Then I put into my mind the prospective that if there was a lord that heals the wounded and aids the sorrow of the world, that wouldnt this be a fitting punishment for all the disbelivers?  If I were god, I would think so.  Im not saying the whole ordeal made me into a beliver, because it didnt. But it made me think. It's still making me think.  I hate thinking.

3358564,female,Education,"   Ok, I'm writing up a syllabus for my literature class which will start in about two weeks.  They've changed the edition of the anthology. Certainly, I am glad to see that Shakespeare still matters--indeed! However, I'm getting annoyed with the enduring myth which claims Shakespeare's sonnets were written in the early 1590s.   Do these editors who put together these anthologies even read the latest scholarship?  I don't care what tradition holds. So sometime around 1595, Frances Meres writes that Shakespeare's Sonnets, were 'sugared,' and that is supposed to tack a date down for us?  Katherine Duncan-Jones, in her latest edition of the sonnets, has suggested otherwise; maybe as early as 1603, to perhaps as late as 1608-9. I tend to agree.    Let us consider the notion of revision for once. Shakespeare may have written some sonnets around or before the time of Romeo and Juliet, early 1590s, 1594-95, but most of the sonnets are indeed problematic, and dark, and cynical just as the latter 'problem' plays, which were written after the new millennia--1600. Surely before the publication, he had time to revise, being that the theaters had been closed and problems of plague in London.   I find absolutely nothing in these poems which suggest any notion of Meres' 'sugared' sweetness, but scholarly tradition is adamant. Yet still, I think the common assumption is wrong. Let's just look at 'sweetness' in the poems:            'For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds,             Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds'              (94,13-14).   Clearly, the lines are anti-sweet; in fact, the speaker seems to suggest just the opposite. Weeds are preferred over a multitude of sweet smelling flowers.  The image is not nice: weeds are better than flowers.  Really, who would rather have weeds instead of an abundance of growing flowers?    And again, the couplet of Sonnet 118:             'But thence I learn, and find the lesson true,             Drugs poison him that so fell sick of you'              (118, 13-14).   The language and imagery here evoke the illness and bitterness of being in 'Love.'  This speaker is jaded.  He's not sweetly in love; he has been poisoned by her. And this whole, 'sick of you.' It lingers.  It's like he's saying, 'I'm sick of you, and how you intoxicate me, enchant me, as if I'm taking a bad drug.' It's like a chemotherapy experience to him.  And certainly last but not least, Sonnet 147, one of my favorites,                  'For I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,          Who art as black as hell, as dark as night'           (147, 13-14).   Clearly the speaker, is disillusioned.  He once thought his beloved to be bright and angelic, but now he concludes that she is a diabolical imp. Essentially, he's telling her 'you are a lover from hell!'  Is that a sweet term of endearment?  And certainly, I could go on and on.  There might be a few sonnets which evoke 'pathos.'  However, debatable, how does one explain the cynicism as revealed in these couplets?  And it is just not these three poems.  All over the sequence there is this underlying sentiment of despair, frustration, and exhaustion.    My point in all of this?  How can scholars be so rigid in suggesting that these poems are indicative of a less mature Shakespeare? By asserting that these poems were indeed written in the early 1590s, we dismiss the complexity, the cynicism, the sexual frustration, and the over all peculiarity of these poems.   I don't believe that the Shakespeare who wrote 'Romeo and Juliet' could have written these poems.  This speaker/lover does not 'Kiss by the book,' as Juliet would say.  No, this speaker is misogynistic like Hamlet, and he's disillusioned like King Lear, and slightly jaded like Prospero! These poems have been revised, and were written by an older Shakespeare probably around 1603, and then published in 1609.    Somebody at the MLA please get the word out!            Jumbled Chaos   "

It was an early morning. 3:00, 4:00, and 5:00 should not come twice in a day! How ironic that Ked took me to the airport at 4 p.m. yesterday and then again at 4 a.m. this morning! Neither one of us got very much sleep last night because we kept waking up afraid we'd miss the alarm! My flights left on time and it was smooth sailing. I had plenty of time in Atlanta and thank God, my luggage was waiting for me in Flint. Took me awhile to find it thanks to the lady behind the counter. I told her that it may have come last night and she told me to wait by the baggage claim and if it didn't show up to come back. So I wait and I'm the last person there and my suitcase isn't there. So I traipse back to the counter and sure enough it was behind the counter. Couldn't she have looked there first and saved me 20 minutes?? Anyway, I was just so thankful to see my suitcase!  Dad was there to pick me up and we made it to Nashville about 12:30. I went straight to bed and slept for about 2 hours! Then I got up took a shower and felt oh so refreshed. I hope I didn't sleep too long that I can sleep well tonight! Of course, I never sleep that well when I'm not with Ked.  It's been nice to see everyone and tonight we had a scrapbooking party. Good times. Well that's all for now!!               "

There is a dining room with seating for 12, there is a living room (no TV) and a family room (with a color TV so I can see, the Knicks play basketball), there is a media room (High-Def, DVD, stereo, those couches that shake with the bass), and a built-in stereo with speakers in all the key rooms, including the fitness room.  There is a finished walk-out basement with an 8 foot slate pool table.  In the backyard, there is room for a nice garden and for a putting green surrounded by sand traps.  There is also a writing studio that is topped by a greenhouse.  There is a tennis court, with basketball rims at each end, and there is a phat-ass garage.  The whole house is powered by on-site solar and wind energy and has a whole bunch of windows.  Last, there is an underground bunker supplied by its own independent filtered oxygen source and accessible from any floor in the house where we can escape when the terrorists attack (instead of duct taping plastic all over everything like suckas!).

4192173,male,Technology,"             Back from another trip to LA...saw Saintface last night at their biggest gig to date at the Mercury Lounge. Though they might argue, the gig was a success. Good crowd, band was tight, Peter's voice was in fine shape. They have new song called 'There Is a Room' that is really solid. However, someone needs to convince my friend Peter Saintface to record a goddamn album already. The man has 4 albums worth of songs and only has 1 EP out. Leaving these gigs without having the songs at home to listen to makes me freaking mental. The person who convinces him to record an album gets a free drink from me (and Dorigen)...  Going back and forth with Jared on the new round of Chemlab demos, which I have just received. It's getting there. I think the record is at that point where it's a few weeks away from being great (and finished)...Jason/Jamie are now on tour, which gives Jared some time to go and record some more vox and think about changes, etc. I'm a big fan of this album. I'm gonna try and do some last minute synth parts before Jason and co. come to stay at MOGworld when their tour hits NY this weekend.  In other news, the hypefactor live experience is currently being pondered...Since there are only 6 HF songs, I'm throwing around eclectic ideas from the days of MOG past. Kudzu Rail anyone?

Who is the last person you talked to on the phone?   The Star Tribune called me; they want me to up my service.  I said 'how did you get my work number?' then hung up.  Was that rude?   3. About how many telephones do you have at home?   Two cordless; two cell. (Don't hate).   4. Have you encountered anyone who has really bad phone manners? What happened?   I used to work for a U.S.S. who is a great guy and is now a Washington player.  When he was done talking, he would just hang up.  No hate intended, but rude city baby.  I said nothing to him about it (hello, I was an intern), but others worked on him a great deal.   5. Would you rather pick up the phone and call someone or write them an e-mail or a letter? Why or why not?   I would rather e-mail.  Although, sometimes the phone call cannot be replaced - people don't always understand your mood and meaning in writing.

883178,male,Fashion,"           In a scene that typifies the entire film Fahrenheit 9/11, Michael Moore shows a stereotypical All-American boy talking about winning the hearts and minds of the Iraqi people and teaching them about freedom and democracy just after a harrowing scene involving a late night (pitch dark) raid into an Iraqi&nbsp;family's home.&nbsp; We don't know why the raid was done or whether it was appropriate or not.&nbsp; We can intuit that since the beginning of the war, some raids have taken place without justification or with ill-founded justifications because we know that war is hell, but this scene, which makes it extremely easy to empathize with the set-upon family, is bone-chilling.&nbsp; As humans, it's impossible to watch without feeling for the family and without being thankful that it's not happening to you.  &nbsp;  I say it typifies the movie because the emotional impact of the scene and therefore the movie is undeniable.&nbsp; Michael Moore has made Fahrenheit 9/11 with the purpose of affecting a response, and he does it.&nbsp; I laughed out loud several times during the film, I cried at least twice, and I left awestruck and outraged.&nbsp; Presenting the material as he does is extraordinarily manipulative.&nbsp; It is propaganda (in the way that the word, divorced from pejorative connotations, just means to share information in a way that persuades people) of the highest order, and I understand why he has drawn comparisons to some of the great propagandists of all time.&nbsp; Moore uses slight of hand, juxtaposition, irony and maybe commits the sin of omission from time to time,&nbsp;but&nbsp;he is not dishonest.&nbsp; It is one of the finest movies I have ever seen, and I am convinced that it will change the world.&nbsp; It may not lead to regime change here (the film might be so incendiary that it actually makes those who are not inclined to see it Mike's way even more recalcitrant - or, gulp - even more motivated); but it will change the way campaigns are carried out.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I have seen two of Michael Moore's other films:&nbsp; 'Roger and Me' which I thought was unique and engaging, but ultimately more tomfoolery than substance, and 'Bowling for Columbine' which I thought was brilliant at times, but lacking in subtlety, and filled with poor decisions (he ends up looking like he was picking on Charlton Heston.&nbsp; Yes, Chuck Heston is an asshole, but the effect Moore wants is not for us to feel sorry for the asshole, and even an asshole comes across as sympathetic when that asshole is about to go down to Alzheimer's. &nbsp;Asshole).&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, I tend to judge those I agree with more harshly than those I don't agree with, and Michael Moore earns more of my criticism than he should.&nbsp; In this film, he seems to have invested his heart and soul into its message, his mind and energy into it preparation, and his connections into its distribution and promotion.&nbsp; It is so direct an attack on a sitting President, I had the thought, as I drove home, that Mr. Moore might end up dead here pretty soon.&nbsp; It is that powerful.&nbsp; One review I read said it best: &nbsp;'as the man said, if you shoot for the King, you better kill him.'  &nbsp;  It seems that just about every decision he made was the correct one (and yes, logic tells you some things are a bit far fetched. For example, George Bush is criticized for removing the name of a fellow soldier from a medical report that he issued.&nbsp; That soldier goes on to become powerful and connected and corrupt (tied into the whole Carlyle thing).&nbsp; The implication is that Bush removed his name so that we would not see that connection.&nbsp; However, I know from my days in the trade, that when sending records out related to a particular person, it is routine to delete references to private information concerning other persons who are not covered by the authorization to release records.&nbsp; Yes, it is possible that at the Presidential and media level, the rules are different (the media may want to know that soldiers name so that they could interview him about W in his National Guard days), and no, Moore could not go into that level of detail and still have a watch-able movie, but you get the sense that motives are being attributed when they shouldn't be.&nbsp; By contrast, much has been made of Minnesota's own Mark Kennedy who, when confronted about signing up a child to fight in Iraq, apparently said to Moore that he had a nephew in the military (but not in Iraq) only to have his response edited out.&nbsp; When you see the film and you see the look on Kennedy's face just before they cut to another scene, you will know why  I would have ended it right there too, if I had Moores flair and talent).&nbsp; I could go on and on, but suffice it to say that for me, the end result will be stunning for some.&nbsp; My life was changed forever, but as I was busy quoting my&nbsp;dear friend HAL who said 'if even 1/10th of it is true, Bush should not be President,' I looked&nbsp;over at Mrs. Duf, who, at some point during my 45 minute tirade, had fallen asleep.

The foot-dragging is astonishing, given that Congress has access to classified documents detailing the abuses outlined by Maj. Gen. Antonio Taguba in his report on Abu Ghraib. Rolling Stone obtained those files in June and offers this report on their contents.  The new classified military documents offer a chilling picture of what happened at Abu Ghraib - including detailed reports that U.S. troops and translators sodomized and raped Iraqi prisoners. The secret files - 106 'annexes' that the Defense Department withheld from the Taguba report last spring - include nearly 6,000 pages of internal Army memos and e-mails, reports on prison riots and escapes, and sworn statements by soldiers, officers, private contractors and detainees. The files depict a prison in complete chaos. Prisoners were fed bug-infested food and forced to live in squalid conditions; detainees and U.S. soldiers alike were killed and wounded in nightly mortar attacks; and loyalists of Saddam Hussein served as guards in the facility, apparently smuggling weapons to prisoners inside.'   read the rest of the article  urlLink here .  i'd warn you in advance about the graphic content, but it should hardly surprise anyone at this point.

883178,male,Fashion,"            Hot in the City  By Duf Fer  We have had a pretty rough run in 'The Paul' lately.  The week before vacation, a suspected car thief was arrested in our back yard and trashed Mrs. Duf's garden while cursing and waking up TinyDuf at 3 a.m.  Five officers were involved in the hunt, and none of them can distinguish echinacea from weeds.    The next day, the suspected car thief's girlfriend came to our house (our address is a matter of public record) looking for 'keys' that her boyfriend 'dropped' in our yard while hiding out from the police officers (before being found by a bad ass police dog).  The police came by soon after her and said that his keys were included among the items they checked into holding when he was taken to jail.  Their theory:  he dropped drugs in our yard.  I was out of town during the whole affair.  While we were on vacation, our credit card company called and told us that they suspected fraud on our account. Some sucka was charging up a storm (including an $1100 Texaco charge) on our card.  Last night, someone broke into our garage.  All three of our bikes were stolen (including the one I bought Mrs. Duf for Mother's Day this year - it's been ridden twice), our garage people door was damaged severely, and my wife's car stereo was stolen (DJS, I like the way you gave the gift to DJ LZ, and perhaps I will do that too someday to replace her stolen stereo (JK)).    While on vacation, we cleaned out our garage, and among the items we threw away...her old car stereo!  My response to all of this misadventure is almost as upsetting to me as the events themselves. I:  1.  Want to move to a better neighborhood; 2.  Have been spinning theories about who stole our credit card and who broke into our garage, and it is someone I know; 3.  Have been feeling guilty about traveling so much because I have these testosterone driven (and illogical) notions that if I were home, Mrs. Duf would be safer.   4.  Have been thinking about getting a home security system; and  5.  Have been re-examining the propriety of traveling so much and questioning the balance between providing for my family in a job I love (making a good living) and being home more often (even if it means that I earn less money).  This balancing act is a near constant struggle for me.    But mostly I have been thinking about being a better provider and buying a house in a better place so that when I am gone, everyone will be safer.  Our current plan for moving is a 3 year plan.  This will allow us to make home improvements, and it will allow us to be better positioned to buy a house that we can live in for a lenthy (nod to DJS) amount of time (we will save, increase income and decrease expenses (bye bye daycare ($1000 per month), hello public schools ($0 per month)).  But with all these happenings, I wonder if we should not scramble and stretch and just get the hell out of our part of the city now.  No answer seems correct.          "

In that instant I started laughing hysterically and realized that I have taken the blogging thing a little too far when I'm telling my husband that he'll have to read my blog to find out the events of my day to day life! As the absurdity hit me I couldn't stop laughing. When I did settle down, I told him the story, complete with a reenactment and he thought it was quite hilarious. Silly me!  I have been receiving a monthly cd from  urlLink Thrive!  the women's ministry started by John Maxwell's InJoy. Ladies, if you hear that the Thrive! simulcast is coming to a church in your area this November, I highly recommend that you attend. It was an awesome event packed full of great worship and powerful teaching. Anyway, I've been listening to the monthly cd's when I workout. Each month they pick a topic, interview someone, give a devotional, and close with a book review. It's a great tool. Today I was listening to the topic of grace and their interview with  urlLink Randy Alcorn . He pointed out something that I'd never thought of in this way before. He said that grace and truth must go together. Grace without truth he said is just tolerance and that's quite different than grace. He said to just say 'whatever' and let people live as they please does them no good and he says the church often fails on this point. He pointed to an experience he had in a small group. After a couple months of meeting, he discovered that one of the couples was not married but had a child and were living together. He and his wife sat down privately to discuss the matter with them in grace and truth and to help them see that what they were doing was not right and bore consequences. This couple, although both believers, had never been told that their lifestyle was wrong and they were surprised that no one had ever helped them with it before. It turns out that finances were an issue, so the small group took up a collection for them and Mr Alcorn conducted the wedding and helped this couple correct their situation so they were no longer living in sin. He also said that truth without grace is not good either. He said especially in raising children you must have both. You can't pound the truth into their heads, you must teach it while also teaching and living grace. He discusses this more in his book  urlLink 'The Grace & Truth Paradox.'  Grace and Truth. What a concept.  One more bit of information! I mentioned this article around Mother's Day and I just saw that it was posted online. It reminded me of Ked, Kurt & Ken and I laughed til I cried every time I read it. I sent the link to my mother-in-law and she replied saying, 'Her #1 tip is the truth, and the one that keeps you sane!' Enjoy!  urlLink Been There, Survived That!                "
883178,male,Fashion,"            Beware Freaks Bearing Gifts  By Depressed Duf'  It never ceases to amaze me how those who trumpet patriotism with words are also those who debase it most with their actions.    In Washington, some Senior White House official has ratted out a spy.  This is counter-espionage.  This is treason.  This is the opposite of 'united we stand.'  The USA Patriotism Act is an assualt on personal freedom and the bill of rights that would make Mussolini blush.    In California, a long standing tradition of respecting the voice of the people was ended by a recall of a Governor (unpopular though he was) who had committed no crime or malfeasance of any kind.  Last night, farce concluded the tragedy; vox populi became pox populi.  May we get the elected officials we deserve.  My favorite piece though is that while states all over America are rushing to make students recite the pledge of allegiance, our transition team in Iraq is working to remove dogma and patriotism from the schools there.  Apparently, in Iraq, style over substance is disfavored, and a return to educating children means decreasing time devoted to anything except the three R's.  I like the pledge of allegiance.  I don't think anyone should be forced to say it (that pesky first amendment and all), but the pledge, in and of itself will do little to make children understand or love America.  For that, I think we should favor more substantive things.  Of course, it would mean a shift away from words and toward action.         "

I don't know, I don't wanna blow anything that's for sure, but should I really just throw everyone else away? and also right now the friendships I have with people kick ass and I love spending time with them, I don't wanna lose that either. Oy, what to do. Life is messed when it comes to things like that, like you, or at least I do/did, dreamed and like wished to have a one on one relationship with someone forever and then when the opportunity to actually have one comes about, it just doesn't feel right! If that doesn't happen to you, well then I guess it's just me!  I think another problem I have is that it never seemed like people liked me before or something because they didn't think I was hot or whatever, or I don't even know, but ya I always wanted people to think I was like damn hot, and now it's like the opposite, I don't know if people like me because I'm hot and they just want some ass or my ass or if they really actually like me. Like ya I'm always fishing for compliments, what can I say I like attention, but when all I hear is like 'wow your hot' ya it's flattering, but hey maybe you can prove that you like me for me! not for my body! Wow I swear life is too damn twisted like that. Whatever.  Even though I'm confused about it all, ya I'm liven summer, what else can I say, I've got plenty of guys, I get to sleep and hell I get to wake up and actually not know what I'm doing!

I had been receiving both on a pretty regular basis up until the first week of November.  Then, nothing.  No little love notes from the state attorney's office telling me that he showed up for the court date.  No little envelopes containing the check that was keeping him out of jail.  It all stopped cold.  So, I called the State Attorney's Office for Child Support today.  First I had to hold for 20 minutes, then give the ritual information of name, social security number, current address, yadda yadda, ad naseum.  Then, I finally got to tell the nice lady that I just want to know what's going on.  She advised me that a warrant was issued for his arrest last month, when he didn't show up with the purge payment.    Of course, I have reservations about how this will affect my karma.  However, considering the guy is now unemployed and no longer contributing to the support of his children, I say let him serve his 45 days.  At this point, it makes no difference to me at all.

I'm in Zagreb, Croatia, where I did a gig last night (this is a pretty jet-setting time for me - I'm in Berlin in a few days).  It was my first time doing a gig to an audience who predominantly spoke English only as a second or third language.  Very interesting.  They were fine with most of the references (Bush, Iraq, Tony Blair, Harry Potter) and highly amused that my surname means 'poo' in the country of my betrothed.  The Bosnia/Croatia war was a no-go area, since Britain and France opposed Croatia's independence (I knew John Major would one day try to ruin a gig for me) and I think they were a little taken aback by my take on Catholicism, but it was a great night and felt really historic.  This is Croatia's first attempt at starting stand-up comedy and it was only their second show.  It's weird - I've never been shown actually doing my act on TV in Britain but in Croatia it took exactly one night.  Today I walked around Zagreb for about 3 hours.  It's a really beautiful city and has pretty much recovered from the war, cosmetically at least (socially, they have that World Bank/IMF thing going on: 5 per cent of the population is filthy rich and 40 per cent are below the poverty line).  Anyway, I've enjoyed being here immensely and thought I'd share.

According to The Sun newspaper, the pair met by chance at the Electric Cinema in London’sNotting Hill. 'We got talking about music and agreed we should do something,' explained Brown . He added: 'Noel sent me some music he’d done and I recorded a vocal. The result is brilliant, I’m really excited. I hope it will be a single.' The news comes after denials from the Oasis camp that Liam was to form a supergroup with ex-Roses guitarist John Squire. As previously reported onNME.COM, the band claim the story was 'dreamed up' by editorial staff atThe Sun. Oasis are currently working in the studio on the follow-up to ’Heathen Chemistry’, which is due for release later this year. Brown’s new album is expected in August or September.          "
1103575,female,indUnk,"       This is that Sylvia Plath poem I was talking about.  Tulips                 Sylvia Plath        The tulips are too excitable, it is winter here.      Look how white everything is, how quiet, how snowed-in   I am learning peacefulness, lying by myself quietly   As the light lies on these white walls, this bed, these hands.   I am nobody; I have nothing to do with explosions.   I have given my name and my day-clothes up to the nurses   And my history to the anaesthetist and my body to surgeons.   They have propped my head between the pillow and the sheet-cuff      Like an eye between two white lids that will not shut.   Stupid pupil, it has to take everything in.   The nurses pass and pass, they are no trouble,   They pass the way gulls pass inland in their white caps,   Doing things with their hands, one just the same as another,   So it is impossible to tell how many there are.   My body is a pebble to them, they tend it as water      Tends to the pebbles it must run over, smoothing them gently.   They bring me numbness in their bright needles, they bring me sleep.   Now I have lost myself I am sick of baggage -   My patent leather overnight case like a black pillbox,   My husband and child smiling out of the family photo;   Their smiles catch onto my skin, little smiling hooks.   I have let things slip, a thirty-year-old cargo boat      Stubbornly hanging on to my name and address.   They have swabbed me clear of my loving associations.   Scared and bare on the green plastic-pillowed trolley   I watched my teaset, my bureaus of linen, my books   Sink out of sight, and the water went over my head.   I am a nun now, I have never been so pure.   I didn't want any flowers, I only wanted      To lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty.   How free it is, you have no idea how free -   The peacefulness is so big it dazes you,   And it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets.   It is what the dead close on, finally; I imagine them   Shutting their mouths on it, like a Communion tablet.   The tulips are too red in the first place, they hurt me.      Even through the gift paper I could hear them breathe   Lightly, through their white swaddlings, like an awful baby.   Their redness talks to my wound, it corresponds.   They are subtle: they seem to float, though they weigh me down,   Upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their colour,   A dozen red lead sinkers round my neck.   Nobody watched me before, now I am watched.      The tulips turn to me, and the window behind me   Where once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins,   And I see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cut-paper shadow   Between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips,   And I have no face, I have wanted to efface myself.   The vivid tulips eat my oxygen.   Before they came the air was calm enough,      Coming and going, breath by breath, without any fuss.   Then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise.   Now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river   Snags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine.   They concentrate my attention, that was happy   Playing and resting without committing itself.   The walls, also, seem to be warming themselves.      The tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals;   They are opening like the mouth of some great African cat,   And I am aware of my heart: it opens and closes   Its bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me.   The water I taste is warm and salt, like the sea,   And comes from a country far away as health.     "

3581210,male,InvestmentBanking,"             There are a few ways to beat the heat here in Seoul. One is to simply stay at work, but with the government-imposed  urlLink 5-day work-week  coming into effect (and since I can't really figure out why I'd work 7 days a week) that isn't a very viable option. You could go to the beach, but it tends to get a little crowded (as  urlLink this story  attests). Or, you can go see movies. If you do, though, as I noted in a  urlLink past blog , get ready for some comedy--and I mean before the movie starts. One of my favorite theatres is the brand-new Fantaseum in Daehangro. The staff there have some pretty wild costumes. There is a Chipper's restaurant on the top 2 floors too (where apparently the food isn't so hot, but there's a magic show to extertain the kids). The Chipper's staff (even the guys) have aprons and lace collars on their uniforms, and the female theatre staff have, get this, wings. Ya, they're dressed as angels. See pics.   urlLink     Angels complete with wings and Squid...the whole squid   They also all have this cute (well, hilarious is more appropriate) little salute they do when they greet you and say good-bye. They put their left hand on their hip, their right hand up (as if they're swearing on a bible) and touch their fingertips together while at the same time bending their knees. All this they do with a smile on their face. (If you don't get my description, think of a gay Nazi doing a Heil Hitler and you'll be pretty close.) Man, the things people do for part-time work.  Oh ya, the squid is there for general interest. It's restaurant display. I've seen dishes with hacked-up squid in it, but not one with (what looks like at least) a whole squid on the plate. Interesting.  Anyhoo, this weekend I saw 3 movies...one Korean and two Western ones (not spaghetti Westerns, just non-Korean/foreign). The Korean one was  urlLink (형님들의 도시)목포는항구다  (Hyung-nim-deul-ui do-shi mok-po-neun-hang-goo-da, or Mok-po: Gangster's Paradise). It was a pretty entertaining film, although some Korean humor I'm still trying to figure out. It goes from serious to amusing to gross in like 3 frames. One scene is with these 3 minor gangsters who are so poor they have to eat dogfood, but it gives them the runs and later (when you least expect it) a serious scene cuts to them running into a single-stall public loo. Well, the senior guy goes in and prepares to blast-off (so to speak) but the seatcover falls and he lets loose on it instead of into the bowl. They show you the mess oozing from between the cover and his legs and even outside the stall where it envelopes the (bare, for some reason) foot of his junior. My God, is there anything more repugnant? These guys were kind of a show-stealer (or a party-pooper, depending on your viewpoint).   urlLink     Mokpo, Gangster's Paradise; King Arthur; I, Robot    urlLink King Arthur  was...ok. Lots of action and killing and Braveheart-like speeches, but I can only give it a 3 or 3.5 out of 5. If you've seen Lord of the Rings this one will seem kinda washed out.  I did, however, find that one of the characters, Bors, to be much like my bud from Manchester, Alex. He also resembled Alex's business partner, Mark, but I met Alex first so he gets top billing. Reading about  urlLink the actor, Ray Winstone,  I learned that the character was much like the actor and both were like Alex. Life imitating art imitating life?   urlLink     Alex Bors and Mark...which is which?   I, Robot was pretty cool. I think I may have read part of the book way back in high school (geek that I was/am). The movie had a TON of special effects in it, but (seeing as it was in the future) they all made sense. Things, for some reason, didn't seem over the top, but that may be because I've been desensitized by now. I, Robot gets a 4 out of 5...or, for those out there who are not into sci-fi, a 3 out of 5....hey, Will Smith is in it! Oh, and the naked butt scenes are equal opportunity: one of Will (but I closed my eyes for that one), one of the girl (but I told my wife I closed my eyes for  that  one).  Well, that's it...a pretty boring weekend, for once. Actually got all the sleep I needed for once. I'm sure I won't make that mistake again for a long time.          "

3869393,female,Technology,"       This weekend probably was interesting in a different sense when compared to my last weekend.  The few things that were really there in common were, the 9 pills, which is now up to 10 plus some weird syrup which tastes like a cross of complan and bricks...the thinking mode for the weekend...and one injection...hahaha!  Well, things kindof got started on saturday when I watched this movie called Chalte Chalte, quite an ironic movie about this guy who seem to do everything wrong with this girl, she marries him, and he continues to let her down.  Whatever he did, he did it wrong and earns her anger and heartbreak.   The biggest joke is that the woman knows that he wont change and yet goes back to him just becoz he begs!  Man, this is the heights of stupidity!  Where is the sense of remorse or atleast a show of reason to change for your partner!  Anyway, movie apart this kindof set my thinking mode off.   I needed from fresh air and my parents were kindof busy, so I decided saturdays I will head to the park close by and do some serious work there....so it was for the next 1 hour, I headed to the park and did some thinking in the walk mode.  For that one hour I just analysed my life, where I stood, what I had lost, what I had gained, what I needed to do, what I needed to shed.  Ofcourse, before I realised it began to get dark and needed to head back home, so had my exercise for my mind and body really...Was supposed to head to the beach in the evening, but due to the arrival of my uncle and aunt, just headed the club.   At the club, my next level of thinking began, and there were just two questions which came to my mind.... 1.  What makes me a woman who can swing to any extremes to make people happy? 2.  What sort of a family situation will make me bring happiness to people around me?  To answer these questions, I took out a piece of paper and began to write a long open letter about these two areas.  The more I thought, the more the thoughts kept flowing.....and what do you know, before I knew it the stress began to go sky high and my legs started to go numb slowly.  Thank god for me, was heading back home by the hospital, so took a shot and then headed home.  Obviously, in this condition no one would allow me to sit and do anything, so was packed to bed at 9 pm...boohooo!  Sunday...hmm...different issue altogther, woke up at 9;30am, and decided I was gonna relax and totally chill off.  Spent some time with my uncle and aunt, initiated work on a few pending orders, and then headed to have an oil bath.  Gosh, never realised to what extent I am a 'hot' person..;)  hahaha...well, got the ordeal over with shikakaai....more in my eyes ..hahaha...and some sambarani......hair smells really odd now!!!  Then sat down for lunch at 2pm, boring lunch...hardly felt like eating, so skipped most of the stuff.  Then sat down with my parents and finalized the house plan and gave it to the architect for his expert comments.   Just hope this house comes out well, have done most of the design work in this...and should have one awesome room in the first floor, more like a studio for myself, with french windows and a painting area......and a nice bathtub to doze off hahahaha...with a good walk in wardrobe...hmm..that reminds me ..need to do some big time shopping....hardly been to spencers oflate....or maybe I should head to T Nagar or Pantheon road and pick some hip and low cost stuff up...hmm.....need to ponder over this one!  Seriously need to re stock my wardrobe....its got too boring..too many blues, greens and pinks...need to add some variety....maybe some reds, purples and browns...hmm.....maybe silver.......got this nice salwar from my uncle, a beautiful black with gold work.....looks gorgeous....need to re stitch some areas...too large for me...hahahaa!   Other than this, it  was one boring time with my aunt, hunting brides for my cousin..hahaa...had my grandparents bugging me to check out some guys...but I was like, hey, am the kid of the family, spare me....the queue is jammed in front..;)  Good joke, bu they refused to buy it..hahaha!  One thing is for sure, this weekend was quite an interesting one, very introspective, enriching for my mind and soul and more than anything, gave me a sense of direction for my artistic side!

2948997,female,Student,"        Wanted: Katie Sleeman   Life is complicated, and sometimes I feel like I'm only here to be confused as some higher power finds it funny to place me in situations where everything I believe in and should uphold is tested in a series of ordeals.  Lately, things have been like that. I've been questioning alot, most of all questioning the soul reason I exist along with who I am and what I stand for. I'm not sure who I am particually who I think I portray. Everything I see a movie, or act I become a related character...in some situations good, most of the time bad. (It was not attractive to see me in tights trying to portray Robin Hood)  But the main question to me is who is Katie Sleeman? I'm looking for a resume to submit of me. Who I was yesterday laying in bed trying to sleep is not the same person who sits here. I think I am the perfect example of change considering I am a constant mutation. A constant mass changing never disapearing considering mass can't be destroyed but I float from decision to decision changing experiencing learning trying and being confused.  My friends are a god sent and their constant support always seems to make me happy. I always seem to get in this mood when someone writes messages in YPM or YP documents. Thank Ya'all who signed.  Can I still like or lust? I'm not what my emotions are like anymore. I guess that I can only just exist and try.  Lonelyness is not a factor anymore cause God can't possibilty find it so funny to leave me without a better half. My mind is like a strainer...it's quickly draining.  Well...if you would like to...you know. Wait no you don't know.  It seems that every couple of months I re-evulate everything I stand for but...this 'month' the flavor is as follows: -folk music -the giem (the gym) -afternoon naps -learning how to debate -smiling (rare) -swimming nude -my friends -being what I think I am -being loved    "

2844168,female,Marketing,"                 Well the past couple days have been a whirlwind of fun! We made the 5 hour drive up to MI on Saturday with Uncle Dan. Ked was really really tired of driving!! We made it just in time for cake &amp; ice cream for Ked's birthday at Grandma's. It was a house full of aunts &amp; uncles &amp; cousins! The little cousins had several skits that they performed that were just hilarious. Crazy kids!!  &nbsp;  Then Sunday morning we got up pretty early and headed out to Grand&nbsp; Haven for the day. It was awesome to hang out at Watermark. The last time we were there was last fall during a preview service, so we hadn't ever been to an actual service. It was so awesome to see how God has blessed them all around. We were excited at the growth we saw. Nate and Cession had the service and it was awesome to relive Elk Lake as he and the students shared. Now that they've been home for awhile everything that happened and what they learned has started to sink in. What a cool group of students!!  &nbsp;  Sunday afternoon we hung out with Nate &amp; Jenn and Jenn's sister and brother-in-law. It was really cool to get to know her sister and brother-in-law. I couldn't believe how much she and Jenn were alike. It cracked me up. I think they could have been twins. We went out to lunch at Dee-Light and had some awesome nachos and a great meal. Afterward we walked down to the Mackinaw Kite Co and were playing with the toys. As we walked in Nate said this was a Ked kind of store. Little did he know just how much of a Ked store it was! Ked picked up some juggling clubs and a diablo and entertained a little bit. It was funny!  &nbsp;  Sunday evening we hung out with Cession and had a total blast. I had warned Ked that they were expecting some magic so he loaded his pockets with the standard 3 tricks (I think the only ones he knows anymore!) He got some pretty good reactions. Then we headed to the beach and the guys played football. The girls decided we were cold and hungry so we left to get food and head back to Nate &amp; Jenn's. My car decided they were hungry for pizza so we headed to the hut and ordered takeout. It was fun and the stuffed crust was yummy! Then after we had all re-gathered at the Smith's Ked gave his little message of encouragement to keep up the great work and learn to find and live their point. It was fun evening and we ended up leaving just a little after midnight.  &nbsp;  Today we slept in and we're just hanging out in Nashville. Dad's at camp this week but he came home this afternoon to hang out with Ked. I think they're over at the office strumming the guitars. Tomorrow it's off to Lansing for the day! It's a busy week!!                  "

2581876,female,indUnk,"        urlLink Yale University > 2004 Commencement > Baccalaureate Address   Richard H. Brodhead, Dean of Yale College Baccalaureate Address Woolsey Hall May 23, 2004 Some Words on Outcomes as You Go Out  President Levin and I entered upon our current positions on the same day eleven years ago. At our ten previous baccalaureates, I, an English professor, have read literary passages to graduates as they go forward. For those same ten years, Richard Levin, a professor of Economics, has felt the gnawing pangs of passage envy, aching to escape the rigors of the dismal science for the pleasures of literature. This year, in an academic transvestitism seldom before witnessed, I have magnanimously allowed President Levin to wear the glory robes of poetry. Encourage the boy: didn't he do well?  Actually, what I just said was false. Here is the truth. I myself will be going out with the Class of 2004. I too came to Yale College expecting to spend four years; but through a decimal point placement error only recently detected, I instead spent forty. In recognition of my belated departure, President Levin has invited me to give the speech that he usually gives at the Baccalaureate. That is real magnanimity, and I thank him most sincerely. Is there life after Yale? I admit that it's a novel concept. But as with the traces of water recently found on Mars, the signs are newly encouraging.  Friends of '04, I note that you are dressed in black. Why the gloom? I suppose I know. You are dressed in mourning for the fact that your revels are all ended, and the life and friendships formed here about to dissolve. Four years ago, when we last gathered in this room, your college years seemed to stretch infinitely far before you. Well, infinity does not last as long as it used to, for here you are already, with only few grains remaining to pass through the hourglass before your college life is done.   Or might I guess that for some, your suits of woe bespeak a deeper gloom? At a freshman assembly some years back, I had the experience, like a bad dentist, of jabbing a nerve straight on. On that occasion I told of students who had confided that they thought they has been admitted to Yale by mistake. As I said this, at least eight hundred freshmen gasped as if I had divined their inmost secret. It's thrilling for a speaker to wield such power - so with a sadism unbecoming to a dean, the dentist will venture another probe.  As for the robes of gloom: could it be that one or more of you have arrived at the end of your ride here with your future plans still a perfect blank? Might there be some who have plans but know deep down that what you've signed up for is a perfect figleaf, marginally covering and only temporarily postponing exposure of your scandalous nakedness of real life plans? Haunted by this uncertainty, might there be one or more of you who have had twinges of feeling that - as the Yale Precision Marching Band chants to opposing goalies in Ingalls Rink - It's All Your Fault: all Yale's fault for having failed to provide you with a single marketable skill? If students in the room have not yet felt this, there may be some in the upper balconies who have, or will. Some while back I met a woman in Southern California (I name no names) who revealed that she had not one but two Yalie sons who had come back home after graduation to a new life, not quite what she expected, of getting up late, eating bizarre amounts of cereal, and watching reruns on TV; and who, when pressed about what they might want to go out and do, glared the unspoken words: Don't Go There.  If anyone in this room resonates to this description, I have a message for you: it's going to be all right. Is it any wonder if the end of college should produce a pause before you find the onward way? For the great majority of you, the end of college marks the end of a far longer stretch (for some it began in the days after birth) in which your life has been defined by the fact that you were in school. Since kindergarten or preschool, school was where you spent the day. School was the answer to the question what you were doing with your life. (Remember the convenience of this? Question: what are you doing with your life? Answer: I'm still in school.) A succession of schools set you your annual tasks and challenges. And school said what came next - more school, of course: after fifth grade, sixth; after high school, college.   Now, for the first time, you are about to step out of that structured life into the abyss of the undetermined. No wonder if it's disorienting - what else would it be? But another name for life unstructured in advance is freedom, and other words for the life lived in that territory are independence, maturity, and adulthood. Welcome to them. Will it be beyond your power to orient yourself in that world, find your way in it and make something good of it? In bad moments it may seem so; but think back to your arrival here. When you came ashore at your last terra incognita, you may have felt at a loss, but then something kicked in - some mix of courage, spirit, curiosity, and desire - that helped you go forward to meet this unknown place, engage its challenges, and make it your own.   Do I doubt that the same thing will happen again when you leave here? I do not; you've done little these last four years to make me think of you as helpless or resourceless. I saw the mother from California recently, and when I asked about her sons, I learned not only that they had gone on to absorbing and fulfilling things but that she had no recollection of their homebound or deadbeat stage. The early modern philosopher Bacon wrote: ' they are ill discoverers who think there is no land, when they can see nothing but sea.' So with you: the solid land of a good life is out there for you, however little you can discern its shape or shores. Courage: the strengths that brought you this far will bring you to it yet. And when you find it, you'll learn that you've carried all kinds of valuable things forward from this place, however little they may be visible as assets now.   In recent years there has been much discussion in this country about the need to identify goals and measure outcomes in education. I do not wholly disagree with this mode of thinking as it applies to elementary education. In our world, the cost of allowing young kids to move forward without having mastered fundamental skills is simply too high. But I am much more skeptical about outcomes-based theories as they apply to the kind of education you have received. What we have put you through here has involved some element of marking things to be learned, making you learn them, then measuring to see if you did in fact learn them. But that did not yield what was most worth getting here.   One limit of the outcomes concept of education is that it treats acquisitions as fixed that can prove in fact quite transient. Every one of you has mastered complex subject fields sufficiently to display that knowledge on cue on a final exam only to have it begin seeping from your brain soon thereafter. By a conservative estimate, the things members of the Class of 2004 collectively learned in Yale courses that you have already forgotten is probably equal to the sum of human knowledge gained since the early Renaissance. Parents shocked at this statement are welcome to come onstage, where I will subject you to a public quiz on Ohm's law, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff, the workings of the passive subjunctive future tense, or other outcomes you once reached to great applause before relapsing into the contented ignorance of today.   Such inevitable forgetting is not a scandal in education because the original act of learning taught something more deeply valuable and left a deeper trace: trained deep habits of mind that survive the specific content that was originally attached to them and can then be put to a different use. When the Duke of Wellington said that the Battle of Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton, he did not mean, I think, that organized sport consciously or purposely taught the arts of war. He meant that deep skills learned at hazard in one world, that of play - skills like physical courage, working together in teams, coordinating strategies over space and time in a way that requires continual improvisation and revision in face of changing circumstances - these skills turned out, in ways wholly unforeseeable at the time of their acquisition, to serve a second function, equipping a later self to act in a context radically different from the one where the skills were learned.   In an office I was given the use of at Duke a few weeks ago someone had posted this saying from Ruskin: 'The highest reward of a person's toil is not what he gets for it, but what he becomes through it.' That comes closer to my own philosophy of education, since to my mind, the real outcome to aspire to is the building of the self - a process that does not lend itself to authoritative measure because it is never over and because its ways are oblique. Whatever we pretended course by course and week by week, what Yale really required was that you use its challenges and resources to develop your latent powers and build the more capable you. If you can't yet say what what you learned here is good for, that's because you are not yet in the place where it will show its value and help. The fruits of the deeper education only reveal themselves in time, as a life's and history's emerging challenges - like the Napoleonic Wars unforeseen in the youth of Wellington - call forth their stores of strength.   Could I be more specific about the equipment I see you carrying forward, possibly unbeknownst to yourselves? Men and women of the Class of 2004, you have done a lot of homework. There are 1300 of you and you each took 36 courses running for twelve and one half weeks. Equipped with these facts, I tried to estimate how many books you have collectively read, papers and lab reports you have written, and problem sets you have worked, but my brain got tired before I got the answer. I congratulate you on your colossal diligence, but now that it's behind you, it might be safe to reveal a secret. The point of all that homework was not for you to complete it, but rather, through this exercise, to develop powers that can only show their value when the days of assigned work are past.   In my life I've met people who seemed absolutely to have stopped thinking at a certain point, and to be living on a stock of frozen opinions as limited and antiquated as their aging wardrobes. I cannot promise that this will not happen to you, but I pray that it won't, and if you escape this fate, the work you did here will have helped protect you against it. With luck, years of artificial school exercises will have developed an instinctive drive to keep identifying and assimilating new sources of information and subjecting them analysis and synthesis - dispositions now sufficiently rooted in your nature that they can carry on without external or institutional support. So internalized, the habits that made you a good student in early life can begin to make you something more interesting and more important: an ongoing student of your world and a constructive contributor to its needs.  At Yale academic education never takes place by itself, however, but in energizing interaction with a certain social environment. We've provided you with a thousand classmates, like you in skill and thoughtfulness but bizarrely various in their origins, outlooks, commitments and beliefs, to live with in intimate community and daily exchange. It's my profound hope that the form of sociability you have become accustomed these last four years will prove habit-forming as well, and that you will seek and recreate this sociability on your own when an institution ceases to provide it for you.   As you know, the Brown v. Board of Education decision ending court-legitimated school segregation was handed down fifty years ago this week. But for all the changes it has made, this country is far from having solved the problems of social separation and inequality. It will be for your generation to make progress on these fronts, unless, which God forbid, you fail to make that progress. The role of the well educated here is not altogether reassuring, since as much as any group, the well educated have tended to live and work in enclaves with those who are comparably privileged. Hard to see how that isolation will be of much help with problems of which, nevertheless, all will suffer the consequences. But perhaps the battle for an inclusive society of equal rights and mutual respect will turn out to have been won - or if not won, in some measure advanced - on the intramural playing fields of Yale or in the rooms of Vanderbilt or Bingham or the dining halls of Silliman or TD, scenes of interactions and understandings won across social divides. I have always regarded the intellectual cost of separationism to be as great in its way as its social cost. In this country, those who have stopped thinking are typically those who have stopped interacting with people who might make them think - people, namely, who do not already think more or less the same as they do. With luck you will seek the educating differences others shun, without necessarily remembering where you formed that taste.  Last let me say a word about the idea of service. A loveable feature of this school is its culture of other-directedness, the generosity with which you regard your gifts as existing not for yourself alone, but also for the good of others. I've seen you, unknown to your teachers and for no conceivable credit, working with neighborhood kids in sports camps, or giving music or health lessons or making science cool in local schools; I know of your efforts in this and other countries on behalf of the sick, the poor, the uneducated and the displaced; I know what you have done within these walls to make this community's life more interesting and more rewarding. When college's somewhat artificial world of organized activity dissolves behind you, as it will, I trust it will leave a seed in place for future growth, the habit of using your intelligence to enrich the lives of others. Numbers of you will go to work in teaching, in community health, in environmental causes, and in government service, and I praise you, but those are not the only ways this start could be extended. The world needs every known profession (well, almost every); and in every profession there is a way of practicing that is small-minded and self-serving and another that serves the larger good. Whatever you do, I look to you to make that difference: the best legacy you could take from Yale.  Men and Women of the Class of 2004, you leave here for the valley of uncertainty also known as life. If that brings anxiety, it also brings opportunity, the chance to make a life - and you will. A poet in your class whose words I prophesy you will soon be hearing - David Goren, Trumbull '04 - has written these lines, spoken as to a graduating senior by a soon-to-be-former beloved named Ivy:  I confess, I've grown attached to you -  But now we both have other walls to climb. Growing is something you'll be doing As long as you live, and you should learn to do it elsewhere than the paradise I made for you, imperfect as it was. He's right. You came here, you saw, and you overcame. You grew into this place, you grew up here, and you grew strong here. Now it's time to break its bounds to win room to grow some more. If Yale wanted anything for you, it was to nourish and confirm your will to grow, growth that will continue though we must leave, now, to allow it to continue.  Do you understand me? I think you do. All right then: Let's get out of here.            "

Without further delay, let me get right into the shit and give you the low-down on what's what in the cinema.   Finding Nemo  - Saw this a couple weeks ago and was really excited to see it.  However, I was somewhat sick.  I think I was low on iron or something.  As such, I got really tired and and nodded off during parts of the movie.  Days like this made me wish I still drank caffeine, you know?  I could've really used a shot in the arm.  Anyway, the movie was okay.  Not my favorite Pixar effort, but decent.  I still think Monster's Inc. was the best one.  Argue with me if you want.  I win.   Rating:  7/10   Should've Been Called:  Finding Monster's Inc. More Interesting Than Nemo   The Hulk  - I really didn't want to see this until I saw some kind of special on cable about how they did the effects and stuff.  Then, I HAD to see it.  Am I glad I did?  Sure.  Before I hit the theatre, Dirty and I ate a burrito.  It was delicious.  Packed with tender morsels of chicken and the hot sauce was on par.  I washed it down with some refreshing water and I considered myself full.  Off to the show.  The movie was actually suprisingly good.  I expected shit, but it turned out to be a pretty smart flick.  I don't know that kids will like it much as there's a lot of set-up and the green son of a bitch doesn't show up until almost an hour into the flick.  The ending was a little weird for me.  I mean, what the hell is with Nicky Nolte anyway?  The Hulk's dad turned into some big ghost thing and I just didn't get it.  Worth seeing, though.   Rating:  7/10   Should've Been Called:  Rar! Kids No Like Hulk!!!   Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines  - Another movie I didn't want to see, but ended up checking it out anyway.  I'd heard that the ending was totally unconventional and that it was crazy with action.  Sounded right up my alley, so I decided that after I put in a shift at my part-time bookstore gig, I'd see the midnight show.  I didn't have anyone to see it with, so I decided to be a complete loser and go by myself.  No really, it's okay.  I only cried a little on the way there.  At the theatre, there were so many Asian kids there, I thought I'd mistakenly walked into 2 Fast 2 Furious.  You know...because they like to trick out their Hondas and such.  Anyway, the movie was mediocre at best.  Yeah there was lots of action, but I didn't care for the character development...was there any?  The chick Terminator, the TX was lame.  She didn't seem like much of a threat.  I did learn one thing though: Claire Danes is not an attractive girl.  She looked like ass.  I'm glad I saw it, but I'm not raving or running out to see T3 again.  Oh...and the title mentioned 'Rise of the Machines.'  I saw plenty of machines.  None of them rose.  Hope that didn't ruin anything for you.   Rating:  6/10   Should've Been Called:  T3: Where's James Cameron?   Bruce Almighty  - I know this one is a little older, but I finally got around to seeing it.  The verdict?  It was a piece of shit.  Good idea gone terribly wrong.  Jimmy Carrey is funny in moments and other times I was like: Dude...you're trying too hard.  I don't know.  Then, they had to ruin an already crappy not-funny movie by slapping you on the ass with a moral.  Save it, friend.  I didn't buy a ticket to have someone teach me what's right.  Fuck you.

Sometimes my heart is filled with thrill and awe. Sometimes - with aching and anguish. It all depends on how this space aligns itself. The moment of truth. This dance makes it difficult to know with certainty Which way to choose, Which path to walk, Which heart to trust, Which soul to touch. For one side can not make decisions based on the other. They each demand my all, Yet I yearn for the balance. I am pulled and torn and led away- Sometimes for good, Sometimes for bad. I ponder on God's design- His decision to place man in a real world But to give him a mind that can dream up another. Sometimes those dreams rip us apart. Other times they pull us together. So I will join the dance- Performed to the song of God's providence, Led by the hand of God's grace. Sometimes I might fall. Sometimes I might soar.

3869393,female,Technology,"       This was a beautiful poem which was sent to me by a friend of mine....wanted to have it posted on friday itself, coz it reflected my mindset....  Kept myself educated and learned to train my mind...  So that one day my greatness would shine...  Too many people underestimated my ability and intellect...  That was no problem for me because I conquered every obstacle met...   Now faced with hardships unbearable to face...  Don't know how to rise again, so I just sat down and prayed... &nbsp;I knew that the day would come when I would surely fail... &nbsp;Never knew that I would sink this low and feel so frail...  After surviving all the years of hurt and pain...  My strength and determination would prevail through the rain...  Still difficult to climb that hill...  But my will is too great to stay still...   When all the dust settles and all the smoke clears...  I will emerge back on top higher than I have been inthe past years... For I have faith in myself and that's all one needs... To live in this world where it's difficult to succeed...   So when you feel like there's no hope and want to give up...  Fight with your heart, mind, and soul and I guarantee You will reach the top...          "
3373204,male,Technology,       Saw this  urlLink Interview with writer Karey KirkPatrick  on  urlLink Slashdot  who is the screenwriter for the movie. I hope he doesn't screw it up. Seems a nice enough chap and I did like Chicken Run. I have recently gained faith in the Hollywood writing/directing process because I thought The Lord of the Rings was genuinely good. As were a lot of the Superhero adaptations I've seen.   This is a completely different cup of tea though. Best of luck to him. I wouldn't want his job.         
3034755,male,Internet,"             GMail security flaw: I just discovered a rather serious security flaw in Google's a href='http://www.gmail.com/service, currently in beta. If I wanted, right now, I could access the mailboxes of at least a dozen people, alter their user information, send e-mail using their address and otherwise generally fuck up their accounts.   I won't, of course. But if someone as essentially tech-clueless as I can do it, I rather imagine more savvy and unscrupulous parties are ready and waiting to exploit this weakness.  Further: It's not a technical flaw with the GMail system. It's a combination of poor user interaction design and a little social hacking that opens up the system to potential abuse.  I was poking around the  urlLink  site, just to see if by some miracle they'd opened sign-ups and not told anyone. (They haven't.) But I clicked on everything that I could, including the link under the login panel asking 'Forgot your password?'   That takes me to a page where I'm asked to 'enter the email address you use to login.' At random, I picked the address of a friend I knew had recently obtained a GMail test account and submitted it. I then had to pass one of those tests where a graphic of a word or nonsense phrase is displayed and you have to type it into a box to prove you're a human and not a computer.  After doing that, I'm presented with a security question, presumably one chosen by the GMail user to further verify their identity and help them recover their password. This is where the system starts to break down. Several people have custom questions, unique to them and requiring somewhat intimate information about themselves. In the case of the random friend's account I'd plugged in earlier, it was something I knew about them off the top of my head. If I didn't, though, I'd easily be able to ascertain the answer by reading their website.  I gather that 'What is your Mother's maiden name?' is one of the default security questions. It's a bad one. In the case of at least three friends, I didn't know it but was able to easily obtain it by plugging their names into, yes, Google and having the information spit back to me from publicly accessible genealogy websites.   Now having a security question isn't a bad thing, per se. It's just not very tight security, particularly when many of the people using the service are, themselves, web publishers and have chosen particularly poor questions with easily researched answers as the key to their account. But it still requires a little effort; it's not as though a simple computer program could batch through dozens of accounts and compromise them. It requires a thinking, Googling human to get past the security question.   Ah, but when you do! In other systems, passing this hurdle would generate an e-mail to a second account, either revealing the password or containing instructions for resetting it. With GMail, though, I'm immediately presented with the option of resetting the password. Input a new password twice, click submit and voila: I'm in charge of another person's account.  This makes GMail extremely insecure.   There are two ways to address this. First, if you're using GMail right now, I'd suggest choosing a security question to which only you know the answer and which is not answerable by Googling for information about you. (Good advice always, but particularly in this case.) Mothers' maiden names are right out. Names of first pets? Suspect, when a lot of us have taken and published the results of 'What is your drag queen name?' quizzes on our websites. Old phone number? Probably tucked away in a long-forgotten, never-updated online database.  The second is for Google to tighten up the process by requiring password changes to involve an e-mail challenge or some other means of resetting an account password. Knowing a person's GMail address and a little personal info about them is too low a hurdle to put the reset mechanism front-and-center where it is now.   At last count, I could easily compromise the accounts of six friends, six prominent webloggers, a Google employee and one random fellow I've never met or heard of.  I haven't and I won't. And another Google employee has graciously invited me to take a test account, which offer I'll accept, even though I wish the service worked with Safari so I could really get under the hood.   In the meantime, I won't be trusting GMail for anything critical and I'll be picking a completely unanswerable (except by me) password security question. I'd advise you to do the same.         "

1103575,female,indUnk,"       So I finally decided I would write about the woman I met a week and a half ago {two saturdays ago.} or just about the day I guess.  It was a good day.  I went to Good Shepherd Parish over in Kansas {Sean's church}  Its a beautiful place, and enormous.  I thought St. Johns was big.  I was wrong.  They were hosting a retreat/workshop type thing for music ministers from the Kansas City/St. Jo and Kansas City Kansas Diocese.  Pat asked me to go and help him present a  workshop called the War between Youth and Liturgy.  So I went, and talked about how we as Catholics see God in 4 parts of the liturgy, in the scriptures, in the clergy, in the eucharist, and in the community.  If any part of the community is missing, the infants, the elderly, the youth, we are missing out on seeing a part of God.  Therefore, efforts to separate youth from the rest of the parish are efforts to seperate the youth and the parish from a part of God.  I understand that this is by no means deliberate, but its wrong all the same.  I also talked about how it is important for parishes to make a strong effort, even outside of confirmation classes {which are often the only exposure high school kids have to Catholicism} to educate youth on the catechetical and canonical teachings of the Church... especially the part about being morally bound to follow our consciences above all else.  Otherwise youth think that they have to follow the teaching to the letter, which often makes them feel already out of place.  Anyway, enough of me ranting about Catholic teachings. {I got it from my mom.  When I was younger I asked lots of questions about the Church, and I always got much longer answers than I really needed.  But that's a good thing.  I like where I am now.  At least concerning my faith.}  Afterwards, the nicest old woman came up to me and told me what a intelligent young woman she thought I was.  I couldn't help but give her a hug, and I think it startled her a little.  I stuck around, and found out a little of how much my name, at 17 years old, has floated around the diocese.  Its always a little scary when you introduce yourself to someone you've never met before, and they go, 'Oh, YOU'RE Rachel Straughn?'...{Its kind of like calling the Chancery, and having people recognize your voice.}  After the last session of the day, I saw the old lady again, and went to tell her how she had made my day by complimenting me.  She  then told me that I had made her day, and said 'Don't you ever let anyone tell you that teenagers are bad, when there are good people like you.' She told me that I was going to become the first female pope... {yes I know, laugh, but if given the opportunity, I would DEFINATELY do it...  if women were allowed to be ordained, then I would most certainly feel that I had a vocation for such} and she also told me that I was a grain of wheat which had fallen on fertile ground.  She made me feel wonderful, just for a little while; its always good to know that there is someone somewhere who thinks so highly of you.  Anyway, so that's a brief look into my Catholic life.   I think I need to talk about it more, because its so important to me... I've found a few Catholic blogs that are all about faith.  I even found one by a priest!  I think that's the coolest thing ever.  Fr. Don should get a blog, ha ha.  speaking of which, I've got catholic social teachings {social concerns} test to study for.  Got to love catholic college prep education.  {PS.  as much as I love the Catholic Church itself, its really important for me to remember that its God I'm thinking about here.  its terrible, but sometimes I forget.  and as for the last few posts, I really do feel more horribly alone right now than I think I have in a long long time, since the nerdy days of middle school.  I've got God, but its still important to feel like you have physically present concrete people who care about you.  And right now I don't.}    "

2948997,female,Student,"       Every time I have a discussion or share a thought process of mine, I feel like I've gone on a rollercoaster of learning and experience. When I get the chance to interact with certain people I realize that I should be happy to be who I think I am. There are always thoughts of my past, reflections of who I thought I once was and solutions I felt would fix everything.  Today as I walked through the card section of Superstore, I stumbled across the 'With Our Deepest Sympathy' I felt a twinge of what would have happened if those pills really had killed me. Would my sister have recieved cards in honour of her pathetic big sister who felt that she couldn't handle the world? Would my parents have recieved gotti flowers and such? Would my friends have thought about the lack of me, and then figured 'screw it'. Then I snapped out of this thought, and just walked on to the cooking chicken section. It's strange how certain events still trigger the deepest memories in your mind. I do not believe that I am sucidal but I can honestly admit that I am clinically depressed which seems like a cope out some days. Days when all I want to do is lie in bed and cry, eat ice cream and tell everyone to fuck off...who knows.   The Future is Fake   An interesting quote that I found in the book I'm currently reading. True.  My deepest fear, is not public speaking, spiders of bugs, but actually people and their emotions and their baggage. People scare me but there are certain people that I adore. I am glad I have this oppurinity to go through this change in me because it feels like something that needs to be done. Another interesting point about my life, is that I've never had the same friends for more than three years...which I'm a little nervous about considering that this is my third year of YP approaching.   I think the best thing that I've heard all day was just to not get involved in the bullshit cause thats what it is. Believe in who you are as a person and well, you'll have to depend on yourself to get yourself across the galaxy.  There are some people in this world that do not recieve the full amount of credit they deserve, and I feel I've found someone like this which I haven't been kind enough to.

I was sooo hapyp and excited, but I wish she had 2 tickets so Marshall could go. :-(.  The I went to Shannon Munsell's graduation party with my family for a little while.  It was pretty boring.  Then Mr. Quindlen drove us to go pick up Jack's friend Henry.  Then we were on our way to take the ferry so that we would get to the Tweeter Center.  When we got there, we met up with Jack's friends, Zac and Dan.  So it was me, Henry, Jack, Zac and Dan all hanging out.  It was so much fun becuase all the guys were sooooo cool.  lol.

589736,male,Technology,"           32, huh?  Youngster  ;)  Why don't I support Kyoto?  A)  I still not accept that there is global warming.  We have hard data going back about 100 years.  Before that, the information is pieced together from journal entries and assumptions of temperatures and oxygen levels taken from ice cores.  100 years - longer than the average lifespan - is not even a tick on the cosmic clock.  The Earth has seen at least one ice age that we know of.  Climate changes in cycles.  How do we know that  if  there is indeed global warming that we are the cause.  We do not have enough data to state that with any kind of scientific certainty.  (I define a scientific certainty as something that happens almost all the time - like gravity; hold an object over the edge a building and let go.  99.9999999999999% of the time it will fall down) B)  Let's assume that there is global warming.  The first time I recall that term being used, I was in 9th or 10th grade.  At that point, the experts said that if we did not do anything, that the polar ice caps would melt within 20 years and that the oceans would rise 100 feet.  You know what?  That was 17-18 years ago.  The last I knew, the Outer Banks are still there.  Manhattan is still there.  My point is, the have been predicting the apocolypse for nearly 20 years and it has not happened.  Again, assuming that global warming is real.  What effects will that have, and what will nature do to counter it?  If carbon dioxide is the real culprit here, then nature already has a built in ability to fight it - plants and photosynthesis.  An oft forgotten fact from your 10th grade biology class is that plants do indeed breath oxygen (as does any living organism).  Of course, plants also absorb CO2 and light and convert that to glucose (I think) and oxygen.  They release more oxygen than they use.  If the temperatures get warmer, the growing season for plants will increase, allowing them more time to do their thing (not to mention increase food production).  'But John, we are cutting down forests and paving over farmland!'.  That is so, but that is not what Kyoto addresses.  I am for slower, more controled growth, with more green space requirements. C)  I am an American.  I like the culture and freedom we have.  I like the prosperity of the country.  Kyoto would severly damage that.  By making us reduce our CO2 levels to below what they were 10 years ago, our economy would be wrecked.  Yes, there may be an increase in some sectors (those that make the expensive new 'green' technology), but not enough to counter the industries that get destroyed by it (cars and manufacturing).  Kyoto does not equitably place a burden on all countries.  The US is by far the hardest hit by Kyoto's requirements. Who do you think runs the dirtiest power plants?  The US with the EPA hawking ever molecule that comes out of a smokestck or some developing country with no environmental controls at all?  Yet, who is forced to make the biggest changes? D)  Again, assuming that there is global warming.  I have not ever heard anyone discuss what effect the 6 billion humans have on this.  We have to be putting out an awful lot of CO2.  We have more than doubled the population of the Earth in the last 100 years.  That has to have some direct effect as well as many secondary (like more need for resources and manufactured products) E)  Because global warming would allow me to play golf all year long.         "

Between graduation and starting work I plan to bicycle across the USA in 48 days...'  Our five year reunion is this summer and some people have chosen to update all those who are waiting with bated breath to see what they have been up to over that last five years.  The above update caught my eye because really, as if the Wharton School wasn't enough this guy had to throw in his hot job in Brussels and then of course the side note about the cyclying across the USA, but that wasn't enough, no, then he had to add that he'll do it in 48 days.  Sometimes, I wish I had gone to a podunk small town college where I would send in updates like 'I just consolidated my debt and hope to be out of my misery is 5 to 10 years.'  And my podunk fellow classmates would think 'Wow, I really wish my life were as on track as hers.  I really need to reassess my life and get my goals straight.'  OK, well, anyway, I've got to run.  My bicycle needs to ridden, around the block in 48 minutes.  Wahoowah!          "
883178,male,Fashion,"            Once Again Back is the Controversial  By Duf 'I love DJS' Fer  OK, ready?  I saw 'Kill Bill, Vol. 1' and I thought it was OK just O...K...  I liked it well enough, but in my view it was ice cold.  There was not much warmth in it at all.  I thought all the acting was good.  I liked the fight scenes.  The 'stylized' violence that everyone talks about was fine.  I could look at Uma's butt for another hour or so at least.  Even with all that though, I dunno, it's hard to explain, but Bill just left me flat.    I read a review in the New Yorker (hated it) and one in the City Pages (loved it), and understood how both arrived at their different opinions.  The New Yorker reviewer said that after he left, he felt nothing and even called the film crap.  The City Pages mentioned the homage to Kung Fu cinema and Brian DePalma (notably the nurse scene - who IS that actress by the way?, I want to give up my current life and follow her especially if she will do that homicidal nurse bit for me) and the use of colors and angles.    By the way, here is a quote from City Pages that will prove DJS right and prove me right too (just kidding, we all know critics are assholes, and only an asshole would quote an asshole to make a point):   But I had no idea that Tarantino possessed the skills to sustain a near-unbearable emotional intensity at the same time. Kill Bill Vol. 1 isn't a career high: Tarantino's masterwork remains Jackie Brown, a haunting tale of careworn love buried in a pulp-novel graveyard. But in its meticulous craftsmanship and jacked-up cinephilic energy, Vol. 1 might be the most viscerally and emotionally overwhelming B movie ever made.    I felt that Uma Thurman did a great job, and I am totally in love with Lucy Liu.  I will see Vol. 2, but I did not think this was one of his best efforts.    Opinion.  DJS:  That Eels show sounds like a little slice of heaven.    Hal:  I'm synchin' right now.  Oh the joys!  BB King:  I miss you.  Call or write.  Panda:  Sorry I missed your MN engagement (two nights only!).           "

1103575,female,indUnk,"       So I found the box in my closet with all of my stuff from World Youth Day in it.  I had forgotten how much that trip touched me.  On our way to Toronto, we stopped at the Shrine of Our Lady of Lourdes, I met Sister Marguerite, who I spoke with for almost half an hour speaking with, and when I left she gave me the special blessing of Our Lady to carry to the youth from all over the world who I would be meeting with, who she said were the Torch-bearers, Our Lady's soldiers of love.  When we got to Toronto, we met our hosts, whose house we would be living in for a week.  Our hosts names were Gerry and Kath.  They had moved to Toronto from England, and they were the most loving people I have ever met in my entire life.  Everything we could possibly have needed they had for us, which included leaving pices of chocolate on our bed every day.  The first night of World Youth Day 300,000 people gathered, and we had Mass together.  I have never felt such great faith in one place.  And I rather doubt I ever will.  It was amazing to hear the Our Father said in so many different languages at once, It truly was beautiful.   Finally the day came when I got to see the pope.  I think it is impossible to describe the aura that surrounds him, or what its like to hear him speak, despite his Parkinsons...  We slept outside with the whole community on the last night, and woke up in the morning to celebrate Mass with the Holy Father.  He blessed us all as we left. When it was time to leave Toronto, Gerry traced the sign of the cross on our foreheads, and kissed both our cheeks, yet another  blessing that had been placed on.  I truly am so blessed. I couldn't even begin to list the miracles that have occured in my life. Thank you.     "
1240631,male,Communications-Media,"       For shear genius,  urlLink Foucault's Pendulum  swings ellispse's around  The Da Vinci Code . The protagonists of Foucault's Pendulum try to prove a point that the afficiandos of the Knights Templar would believe anything...so they make up their own phenomenal history of man--complete with prophesies and death rituals. They soon find themselves pulled into the maddening world of cultists and true believers...and, of course, satanic death rituals.  For genius and plot  Foucault's Pendulum  stands heads above the Code, yet it suffers one fault: The book is long and tedious. I suspect if I really got into masonic writings and long conspiracy theories, I would find it all long and tedious as well. Three quarters of the way through the book, I was fed up with all the cultist idiocies, and just wanted the book to end. There's a large number of people who would believe anything you stuff under their chin...now get to the end....please.  It is interesting the way that people really want to believe in big plots and grand theological conspiracies. Even more interesting is the way that many people really want to play a part in the great fictional dramas. They kidnap young girls, they fly planes into buildings because they feel they have to somehow be a praxis in the grand social movements of time. They read pieces of fiction with their eyes curled up as they ride Trax to the towering granite ediface in the center of town believing that it will give them some secret hidden powers over their enemies. (For those who are wondering. If you ride inbound Trax you will often see people reading a strange book with their eyes curled up as they try to conjure the hidden powers between the words of the book. I was watching one of these creature one day. The creature was literally shaking as he read. He suddenly developed the most sinister grin on his face that I had ever witnessed. The creature closed his eyes and lipped the words he found...ingraining them in his memory. I was obviously witnessing the birth of a great political strike against this creature's enemies. The creature got off at the towering granite ediface stop.  There are times when I really question why I live in the place where I live. I like the mountains and deserts, but I really have a hard time working for people ruled by revelation.  Back to fiction. In many ways, I agree with Orson Scott Card that Science Fiction really is one of the best formats for exploring theological concepts. When accepted as fiction, the format really lets our minds explore different ideas. We can connect absurdities like Umberto Eco. The open acknowledgement of a scifi book as fiction lets us see different ideas without the precept of having to take them for anything more than entertainment. The method works best for people who see all of the wonderously different ideas that can exists.  Fiction can open our eyes to the way the world works because fiction allows the author the ability to really focus in on ideas that nonfiction lacks.  Yet there is also a strange point where cultism, theology, guruism and pure fiction collide. This is what I find troubling. We create a fiction, then people build on that fiction. They destroy that which does not fit in their world, etc..  I guess I should mention, when I was reading Foucault's Pendulum, I had a rather dull witted boss. He could not understand the ending of the book. Caught up in the strange cult history portrayed by the book, he could not understand why Umberto Eco ended the book THAT WAY!!!!  Could there have been any other way? The ending seemed obvious from the first page. There was just the game of connecting dots and seeing just how the predictible ending would come about.  In this regard, the plot of the Da Vinci thriller was better designed. We did not know the true identity of the grand villian until the last chapter. More of a thriller, the ending was quite interesting in that after the villian was unveiled, all of the strange creatures in the book turned out to be normal people...while the ending of Foulcault's Pendulum comes off as a let down. Even worse, some of the 'normal people' suddenly seem like monsters.         "

This is the real reason I'm afraid I'll never have the courage to have kids.} 'When my mother first told me she was pregnant, she added, 'At last! We really are going to fill this house up with children.'  At first I didn't like the idea.  What was wrong with just having me?  My mother, father, and I were our own little unit. As the baby grew inside her, my mother let me listen to its heartbeat and feel it kicking against her, and I started looking forward to seeing this baby.  I hoped it would be a girl, and I would have a little sister.  Together my father, my mother and I decorated the nursery.  WE painted it sparkling white and hung yellow curtains.  My father stripped an old dresser and repainted it.  People gave us the tiniest baby clothes.  We washed and folded each shirt, each jumpsuit, each sleeper.  We bought fresh new cloth diapers because my mother liked to see diapers hanging on the line outside. The one thing we could not settle on was a name.  Nothing seemed quite right.  Nothing was perfect enough for this baby.  My father seemed more worried about this than my mother.  'Something will come to us,' my mother said.'The perfect name will arrive in the air one day.'  Three weeks before the baby was due, it came.  I heard my father telephoning the doctor.  'She won't make it,' he said. 'Its happening, right now.' I walked down the hall.  My mother was sunk into the pillow sweating, and groaning.  'Something's wrong,' she said to my father.  She saw mestanding there and said, 'You shouldn't watch.  I don't think I'm very good at this.'  In the hallway outside her room, I lowered my self to the floor.  The doctor came.  My mother screamed just one, one long, mournful wail, and then it was quiet.  When the doctor carried the baby out of the room, I asked to see it.  It had a pale bluish tinge and there were marks on its neck where the umbilical chord had strangled it.  'It might have been dead for hours,' the doctor told my father.  'I just can't say exactly.' 'Was it a boy or a girl?' I asked. The doctor whispered his answer, 'A girl.'  My father looked shaken, but he didn't seem concerned about the baby anymore.  He kept going in and touching my mother.  I went into my mother's room and crawled up on the bed beside her.  She was staring at the ceiling.  'Let me hold it,' she said. 'Hold what?' 'The baby,' she said.  Her voice sounded odd and silly.  My father came in and she asked him for the baby.  He leaned down and said, 'I wish- I wish-' 'The baby,' she said. 'It didn't make it,' he said. 'I'll hold the baby,' she said. 'It didn't make it,' he repeated. 'It can't be dead,' she said, in that same singsong voice.  'It was alive just a minute ago.'     "

883178,male,Fashion,"            Friday 5:  Done and....Done.   Sponsored by DJS    1. How many houses/apartments have you lived in throughout your life?  Oh, sweet bearded Christ...there's the St. Anthony house with ma and pa shovelpants, then the apartment in New Brighton, then the shithole in Los Angeles, temporarily back to mom and dad's when I moved back, to the house behind Elsie's in Nordeast Minnecrapolis, then to the house in 'upper Nordeast', then a temporary stay in an apartment in Uptown, then back at mom and dad's (transitional), then back to the house in Nordeast, then to another apartment in Uptown, then another, then I moved in with DJ LZ on the busiest intersection in Uptown (Franklin & Hennepin) then finally to the townhouse in Woodbury where we're living happily ever after...until we move in about 3 years.  Lucky 13, baby.  But I'm counting each move.  That's how I do.   2. Which was your favorite and why?  I like our place in Woodbury.  It's ideal in every sense of the word.  Don't have to shovel snow, cut grass or any of that garbage.  Can't.  Busy.  Also, we can park both of our cars in the garage, we get to do laundry a mere 20 feet from where all of our clothes go and last but not least...it's quiet.  I don't hear filthy fat pigs riding around on their stupid Harley Davidsons, firetrucks at 2am, or drunken assholes stumbling out of Liquor Lyle's calling out to their equally drunken friends.   3. Do you find moving house more exciting or stressful? Why?  Stressful as all get-out.  It's the worst thing in the world to do.  I'd rather have someone drop kick me in the ball bag than move my stuff every other year or so.   4. What's more important, location or price?  I concur with my friend, Panda.  Location baby.  Unfortunately some of my locations have been less than stellar.  Hence the moves.   5. What features does your dream house have (pool, spa bath, big yard, etc.)?  I'd love to have a big old office/library where I could work on my latest literary masterpiece.  Attached to that, I'd like a nice big dark room so I can pretend that I'm a big shot photographer too.  A pool would be okay, too, but more importantly I'd like to have a big old spa attached to my kickboxing gym where I'd have heavy bags, speed bags, lots of kicking shields and a full-size ring where I could have my very own fight club.  Oooohh...I'd also like to have a video game arcade where I could have all of the classic vids that I enjoyed growing up.  I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the deluxe stadium-seating home theatre, too.  Perfect for watching my asspocket of DVDs and playing video games until my eyes were as dry as chicken tenders from Arby's.  Yeah, I said it.          "

2844168,female,Marketing,"                  “Mail, you know, stamps and envelopes?”   I’m working on a project that sent me digging through my past today. As I shuffled through three storage tubs full of scrapbooks, photos, and letters I caught a whiff of nostalgia. Two shoeboxes filled with letters grabbed my attention. I chuckled even before opening the box because I knew what some of those letters said. I gravitated to one box full of letters from my old pen pals. I was a letter writing machine in my younger days and had pen pals across the country. It was a good thing too, since that is how Ked and I first became friends and how we started our dating relationship. I oh-so-diligent in keeping my letters organized: sorted by person and by date. Keeping in touch with my friends was serious business! The majority of this particular box was from my dear friend Karen. She was my first pen pal. We wrote hundreds of hilarious letters to each other over the years covering everything from the crazy science teacher to our latest crush. I read one of her letters today and she closed it “love your friend since 1984.” I read that line and thought “1984, wow!” Then I realized “Oh my word, that was 20 years ago!!” Not many people can say they’ve been friends for 20 years. That means I was only seven when we first became friends and started writing – I had just learned how to write!!  As I sifted through the letters a series of thoughts ran through my mind. There’s something to be said about writing letters. Before e-mail and before cell phones with free long distance, letters were the main way of keeping in touch with loved ones. I love smelling the paper (so, I’m a little weird!) and looking at the handwriting. Sometimes there were doodles all over the letter and envelope and even the paper, stamp, postmark, and addresses say so much about the era the letter was written in. A letter is so personal, so friendly, so real. A box full of letters contains so much history, so much culture, and so much about who the person was back then.  I attended a class at a scrapbooking convention where a genealogist talked about the importance of letters and diaries. She commented how, in our current age of phone calls and e-mails, we are losing so much history. Unless we keep all those e-mails (and how many of you have hit the inbox limit and had to clean it out!) or journal in a diary about who and what we talked about on the phone that day we lose all that history for future generations. How many of us have treasured letters written home during war time, or letters pining for the love of our life, or a precious letter from someone who has passed on? There’s emotion in a letter that e-mails just don’t even come close to.   I’m an e-mail, blogging, instant messenging junkie. I would never go back to the days where letters were the main, if not only, form of communication. I love being able to hop online and talk to my mom and friends thousands of miles away about what happened today. I love cell phones and knowing in an instant I can catch my loved ones no matter where they are. But I think that by completely eliminating letters from our communications we are losing a piece of ourselves and our friends that can’t be reclaimed. So maybe the next time you’re tempted to send an e-card for a birthday or a “thinking of you” e- mail, sit down and write a letter. It’ll show that you really care because you took the effort and the time, and it’s more likely to get stored in a shoe box in a closet for years to come.  Summer, 1984 Karen & Amelia                  "

2012853,female,indUnk,"       *Sigh* Not a good way to start a post i know, but its how I'm feeling right now..  The interview this week (i can't believe it was only this week, feels like forever - its sunday night and it was only 5 days ago) was well, it was a little odd to be honest. The first round was easy, I knew that I was doing well, but this second round, truthfully I don't think I was that impressive.   I arrived at the place a little early and like last time, was surprised to find that there were others there that had been there since the morning.. (another batch of recruits).. why am I always surprised?? I have no idea..   I am so naive like that.. They made us go into this small room, and sit at tables and prepare an individual case study. Mine was about car heaters and the production line, and at first I had no idea what to do. I read it a couple of times to get the info into my head since it was swimming from the excitement.  Then, as soon as it was done, they made us wait before we were taken away to do interviews...   There were three people that interviewed me - Wayne, Barry and a lady whose name I can't remember.  I did my presentation and felt stupid doing it to be honest, since it only went for about 8 mins, we talked about the problem and how to fix it. and then about other things also.   They asked me what my best subject was a uni - wasn't quite prepared, said strategic management. I should have said Business in Europe but i thought strategic mgmt sounded better.  it was still a D  - and worst - chemistry.  andyway, i felt a bit naive, i'm this thing that hasn't been out of uni or had a real job and i'm speaking to these ppl that have worked with the company for almost 20 years, and the lady 7 months. she commuted and said she was getting tired. said alot of ppl did it, which is reassuring.  The rest of my week was a real blur. Wednesday I had lunch with Justin, and it was fine, we have always gotten on well. But then on Thursday I was with Dave and we bumped into Justin and he looked sort of surprised, and he hasn't emailed me since ( I had sent him an email wed night).. he was with a girl, a pretty little girl, and they looked pretty uncomfortable. Which was weird. I am not sure how I feel about it really, I felt a bit down really but thats silly cause he knew new I had a boyfriend (as did I, duh!), it wasn't a secret.... sigh,... i don't know.. all i know is that sometimes there are ppl you've always been drawn to and i just don't want the progression  of our friendship to change now that he's met my boyfriend.. he could have just been really busy and not had time to email.. But i don't know whether or not to contact him or wait till he contacts me.   Thursday night i stayed up til 2 writing my assignment presentation which is tomorrow.   ARGHHH!! My LAST presentation for uni!!! YAY!!  Dave's bday was on Friday and i met him for a drink with his work friends. They are nice, very Australian. Then Dave and I went for dinner at Wagamamas and we got lots of little side dishes.. came home to his place, he fell asleep (cause he had had so many beers), and I went home..   We are getting along a lot better now, we were fighting a lot (or I was) for the last couple of months, somehow he was really annoying me by just being himself.. I am not sure if thats ever happened to anyone else thought assume it has. Although I was feeling a little down this week, I am not sure why. He has been very patient and understanding through it all, even though I was horrible..   I bought him towels and a bathmat for his bathroom. He chose them he's getting quite good at it really. They're really nice, his little apt. is very coordinated and relaxing to be at.. Last night we went out with his parents, they're up from Vic and it was like old times. They sure can drink though.... After we saw them last night I was trying to teach Dave some Canto phrases. He's not bad, but its so weird hearing him say things!! But i like it.   THats all I have to babble on about this week..   Tomorrow starts another cycle.. it never ends.   week 12 at uni only about 3 more till the end.   sigh...    Chaz, if your reading this, hope you're doing well babe.             "

Todays oil fields formed as microscopic plants living in ancient seas died and sank, then were buried deeply enough for heat and pressure to cook the organic matter into oil.

Zogging while others thought zagging was cooler than zigging. Well, I quickly learned that my poor HTML 3 skills were not going to cut it out on the open road. That Adobe GoLive could only do so much and too much (bloated code). Too many of my friends were having difficulty browsing my site or even downloading it (not to mention uploading it from a 14k wireless modem). Well, the downloading/uploading problem was easily solved but the browser issues were another matter. I threw my hands in the air and awaited the web world people to get their act together.  The saddest bit about all of this is that the tools to obtain web standards, CSS (loosely: design) and XHTML (loosely: structure)*, were finally accepted in prime time when I eschewed my web presence back in late-Spring of 2001. I've lost three years! Had I been patient or not been so taken by, um, well her name is unimportant...  *Content can be achieved by a variety of means as can XHTML but it is all circular and above the reach of this post.   So, if you are interested in standards, I suggest stopping by the sites  urlLink A List Apart  and  urlLink Asterisk* , the latter seems to be the most focused blog on web design issues regarding standards.  Of course, I am only now crawling out from the waters of theory (read: I was reading books) and onto the land of practice (read: plowing through websites for quick tips as I quickly relaunch my personal website), so there is probably  urlLink a lot more out there  concerned with my standards interests (both arguments for and against) that I've not had enough time to read. Oh, but here's one funny, funny piece,  urlLink Gurus v. Bloggers 2  ( urlLink part one ), for those interested in the contradictions of 'practice what you preach'.

3536864,male,Student,"       I was taking a nap, but then, here it comes. The foreboding call through the house. I was almost asleep when it came. What's this? A sibling needs help with his scooter? Oh no! It's coming this way! Do the sleep act! Quickly I bury my face in the cushions of the couch. I need heellp. Please, hey, wake up! Hello? I try to filter out the calls for aid. Failing at that, I pull the cranky Lord-of-touch-me-and-you're-dead act, and lo and behold it worked. I settle back into my nap..Ah, it's been a good day. My friend came over, stayed up late working on a lost cause escapde  that had been destined to fail since we set out, then I had passed out on the couch. I woke up and took the role of couch potato, then talked to a few friends by way of keyboard, and then ate some food. As I contemplate all this I am rudely interrupted yet again by a more urgent call. My Wheel is coming off! So I grunt, get up, and come outside. AaUgH! The sun! I need my sunglasses. I come back inside, get my sunglasses, and it comes to pass that the bolt had broken. Therefore the wheel was coming out. In my great genius, I don't search for the same size bolt, but find a small bolt with and place large discs on either end. With help from a friend, I tighten the bolt and it works!

3389671,male,indUnk,"       I've been working on my new game for a little while now it's coming along okay. I have a lot of good ideas and am starting to flush them out before actually setting about writing them into code. Recently I've been working on implementing a 2D SDL based particle engine. I've had a few problems because unless I use single pixels for particles I can't figure out how to color them. So I would have to have different particles drawn in each color I would want , or have all particles be the same color. It's so much easier to do in OpenGL. Half the game effects I have planned are particle effects so if I can't figure out how to do them in SDL I may have to do the partiels in OpenGL, I know there is a way to use OpenGL with an SDL window, I just han't read up on how yet.   Right now I'm working on this game less than any others I have worked on in the past. By this point in time on my missile command clone I had already finished an OpenGl particle engine and setup all the particle effects I would use in that game. My lack of work is mostly because I spend more time playing pool than doing almost anything else, aside from sleeping and 'working'.   I need a laptop that can boot and get on my network in about 5 seconds, that way I could just transfer to my laptop and take it with me everywhere. But it's too much work shuffeling code around all the time, and wanting to go out but having to wait for the laptop top boot and then copy over the files. If the USB on my home computer actually worked I guess I could just use a thumb drive to move things around. But alas it does not work. ASUS makes some great boards, but this one isn't exactly the greatest. Maybe I should buy a new motherboard and processor and shuffel this one to my windows system. Hmmmm....my birthday is coming and a nice new ASUS board with a gig of RAM would look mighty fine under the tree. With a nice P4, ohh man, that would be so sweet. The only thing sweeter would be a dual processor board with TWO nice P4s nad TWO gigs of RAM and maybe a 10 gig solid state hard drive.   Well, time to go play some pool I guess.  At least I did write a few lines of code today.         "

883178,male,Fashion,"           That story sounds oddly familiar...Billygoat and I thought my silverfish were coming from Bill, the guy across the hall from me.  Here is his story:  I first ran into Bill in the elevator when I was doing my laundry.  He's this huge, bald, gay man.  Picture Mr. Clean with a lisp.  When you first see him you think 'This guy is going to totally kick my ass' until you hear him say something like 'Oh, I just *love* your shoes.'  So I thought he was just a bit eclectic.  He even offered to give me his XBOX because he said he never used it.  Sweet, right?  Until I found out he was completely schizophrenic.  I started running into him in the hallway at weird times.  He would look at me strangely until I finally asked him what was up.  Bill asked me stuff like 'Did you knock on my door the other night?' or 'Did you hear that pounding before?'  I, of course, answered 'no' to both of these questions.  He then told me something that was really wacko.  'Someone was pounding incessantly on my door last week so I went to the door but no one was there.  When I looked at your door across the hall, I saw shadows of feet under the door.'  I quickly responded, 'Wait a second, bud.  I wasn't even in town last week.'  (the ol' NYC alibi)  But Bill insisted... 'The cops are after me (I'm a drug dealer, but just a *little* drug dealer) and so I think that they have someone watching me who is using your apartment as a hideout.'  WTF??  I told him I appreciated the 'heads up', and I would look out for him and the mysterious door-knocker.  Translation:  'I will continue to dead bolt my door and avoid you at all costs, you freakshow.'  So last week he finally moved out.  More like got KICKED OUT.  It turns out he never paid any of his bills (and I thought drug dealing was a lucrative profession) and he started to use the outlet we had in our hall to plug in HIS ENTIRE APARTMENT.  No lie, I tripped over his extension chord everytime I went to my apartment.  It was pretty funny, though, since I hate the management company for my building and he was really socking it to 'em.

I had that comfort zone with a particular salon back in Canada and they've been cutting my hair for over 7 yrs. But now I moved to Cali, things have changes and I have to start from scratch.

Then I saw posters on the wall with her in a doctors uniform and the big gloves toting a pair of sheerss with the headline saying : 'Who's gonna operate on your head today?'  Fear and disbelief filled my mind and sure enuff she messed up my head...But all thats ok now since I'm going to The Paul Mitchell School to get it fixed right?

Then I hear my name called out and this guy Justin comes out, a punk-ish into the import car scene kinda guy. Nice guy but.....in the two hours it took for him to cut my hair he managed to butcher my head all the while I'm thinking 'it's gonna get better, it's gonna get better, I don't have my glasses on so it must look ok, it's gonna get better'.....  2 hrs later and I walk out with a wack ass MOHAWK!!!!!!! k it's not too bad but a mohawk??....I don't think I'll be heading back to that slaughter house anytime soon. Maybe it's because I go my hair cut done by a phase one student, I should have got it done by a phase two for $5 more...Dammit. Oh well hair is hair and it'll grow back rite? *forced smile*  I think I'll head to a salon after work to get it fixed.....*ponders the thought*  To be continued....         "

883178,male,Fashion,"            I Hang My Head and Cry  By Duf Fer  I am an alcoholic.  I am a drug addict.  I am a homosexual.  I am a genius. -Truman Capote  Im an artist, a poet, a genius, I know it.  I dont buy cheeba, I grow it.   -Adam Yauch  The man in black is dead.  I learned of it this morning while getting ready for work.  If you dont understand Johnny Cash (my wife does not understand Johnny Cash.  When I play his music, she groans audibly.  I wont put her down for that.  Johnny Cash is not the most easily appreciated musician of all time.  He does not sing exceptionally well (and never really did).  He is not exactly Eric Clapton or Jimi Hendrix with the guitar (though his gifts are ample).  There is much about his life that is not glamorous or enviable.  But if you dont understand Johnny Cash), if you dont get why he is so admired,  then you owe it to yourself to try to understand him.  He is one of the best songwriters this country has produced.  He recorded music for almost fifty years.  He is a member of both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Country Music Hall of Fame.  He was a gospel musician.  If you did a graph of the people he inspired and the people they inspired and the people they inspired, you would get all the way from Johnny Cash to Jack Johnson, and you would touch hundreds of artists in between.  Justin Timberlake was apparently raised on Johnny Cash.    The man in black was extraordinarily creative.  Along with his wife, June Carter Cash, he recorded the hit song Ring of Fire which is about a couples love but is derived from a term that every birth mother knows quite well.  By tying the two concepts together, the song asks what you would go through to create something meaningful.  If there is a more succinct statement of the cost of love, I dont know what it is.  Ring of Fire is also an apt description of the creative process or, at least, Johnny Cashs creative process.  As further testament to his creativity, he recorded songs by Sound Garden and by Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails and made them his own.  I adore Nine Inch Nails, but they will never own Hurt again; when Johnny Cash sings the needle tears a hole, the old familiar sting, somehow it becomes so much more powerful.    Johnny Cash wrote books and studied the bible.  He won a lot of Grammys and admiration in both Nashville and New York City.  Hell, earlier this month he was nominated for 7 MTV video music awards.    Johnny Cashs love for June Carter was so profound and sincere, it compelled him to quit drugs and drinking and turn to Jesus.  He prayed daily and sincerely, but he would also kick your ass if you needed it.    Every man should aspire to be like Johnny Cash; every woman dreams of taking a rebel hell-raiser like him and converting him into a family man.    Though it is wrong of me to write it (I never met the man and cannot claim to know him).  I wonder if asked to describe himself, like Truman Capote did, like Adam Yauch did, I wonder if Johnny Cash might not say that he was:  An Alcoholic A drug addict A felon An asshole An infidel A divorcee A sinner A veteran A musician A songwriter A husband An uxorious husband A father A Christian A poet, and  A genius  So this morning, when I heard the news that Johnny Cash was dead, I thought about a couple of his own words.  His words about love for his wife June:   I keep a close watch on this heart of mine.  I keep my eyes wide open all the time.  I keep the ends out for the tie that binds...   Because youre mine, I walk the line.   For his love, he walked the line.  Words are limited.  Actions are too, but much less so than words.  Songs about actions backed up by a life  thats powerful and profound.  Profound like his words about mortality:   I hear the train a comin  Its comin round the bend   Then, of course, theres the gospel standard that the Carter Family made famous, but that Johnny Cash also recorded:   I was standing by my window On one cold and cloudy day   It was so fitting to learn that this great American Icon is gone on a cold and cloudy morning.  R.I.P. Johnny Cash.    [May] the circle be unbroken          "

589736,male,Technology,"           Answer from the Middle:  Dean's status in the polls is founded entirely on an anti-Bush movement.  Ironically, the Left's motivation for this election -- we hate Bush, we gotta get rid of this man -- is very reminiscent of the Right's motivation in the Clinton era.  Both sides -- the Right, then, and the Left, now -- lacked, and lack, a vision, a plan, a drive to execution.  At 9/11, the Right reacted quickly with a vision and a plan, while the Left sputtered and blew the moment.  Now the Left can only play catch-up, and the only thesis on the table is getting rid of Bush.  The Left needs a vision, a plan, and a reliable leader to initiate the march -- one who won't throw it all away on a cigar and a beret.  Until that happens, they will flail about in vague, yet honest, frustration and anger.  For now, the Right has the money and the product:  Fear sells, and everybody's buying.         "

I was thinking last night about how I'm no longer insecure about my body.  At 33, after two children, I'm in pretty good shape, 'kept my figure' as they say.  I'm not big on exercise, although I do enjoy yoga and the occasional run on the beach.  I used to be much more active.  When I was younger (and weighed less) I was so self-concious about my body - especially on those wonderful occasions when I got to be naked with someone.  I've always enjoyed the sensation of being naked next to someone else who was naked.  But, I would try to cover this little curve or that, uncertain of what unkind image it may be portraying of me.  But lately, on those now (unfortunately!) rare occasions when I get to be naked with someone, I don't even think about my body.  I don't care what image it portrays.  I guess I'm just comfortable in my own skin these days.  And let's face it, if I'm comfortable enough with a man to be naked, I'm going to be pretty sure he likes what I've got to offer anyway!   Maybe yoga has helped me to accept exactly who I am, and nevermind the body I'm encased in.  Form is my manifestation, and whatever you read in my body's shape and size has much to do with what I eat and how active I am.  But it doesn't have much to do with my soul and Self.  I have always hoped that as I grew older, I would get wiser.  If this is all I get, I'll be fine.  It's nice to finally not freak out about the skin I'm in.  Diva out.         "

589736,male,Technology,"           Hey all.  Julie was admitted to the hospital yesterday.  We went in for a routine check, and the doctor saw something she did not like and sent Julie down for observation.  Come to find out, she was having contractions and did not even notice them.  She is only 26 weeks, so no one wants to see these babies born yet.  They gave Julie some medicine that did not stop the contractions.  They then tried a different, stronger, medicine, and it did not work either.  By 5 o'clock, her very reserved doctor, was visibly concerned about the situation.  Finally, around 7, the contractions slowed. and have, as of an hour ago, stopped.  Julie will be in the hospital through at least tomorrow, depending on how she reacts to being weened off the medication.  After that though, she will be on mandatory bedrest.  So, that means my availability for any of the group stuff (Road to Glory, dinner parties, movies) are highly suspect for the immediate future.  I will let you know what changes.         "

3022585,female,Education,"       Yesterday I stopped by my nephew's soccer practice just to say hi and show him how much I love him.  He loves to show off, but he also gets frustrated with not being perfect when he kicks the ball.  He's 6.  He has a lot of perfectionist disappointments ahead of him.  While I was there a mother of another child came up to talk to my sister-in-law.  She was asking who was the mother of whom and I said I was just an aunt.  She stated how nice it was that I came out to see my nephew.    During school yesterday a teacher was telling me about a girl who was behaving badly (there is a long story about how bad this teacher is and how she creates the behavior problems in her classroom, but that is for another day).  The teacher was talking about the girl and how she lives with her aunt because her own mother is in jail.  The teacher was trying to point out to the girl that she needed to straighten up because he aunt was good to her even though money was tight in her house.  I hear these stories all the time, an aunt or a grandmother or even a great aunt taking custody kids in their families.  For some reason, yesterday, it hit me that this is wonderful and strange at the same time.  Another little boy told me a few weeks ago with a smile on his face that his daddy was out of jail.  This was a follow up to the statement 'my daddy in jail' that preceded a few weeks before.  I often don't know how to react to these statements and they are frequent.   Richmond is a troubled town.  The murder rate here evens out to about 10 murders a month.  That is unbelievable to me.  Crime is so prevalent that it isn't even a frequent topic of conversation.  The newscasters announce the death tolls almost nightly, but my friends and I don't worry because most murders are gang or drug related.  This makes us feel safer, but should it?  I've become desensitized to so much in this town.  I'm not shocked when teachers or kids tell me about people going into or getting out of jail or prison and I'm not surprised by bodies being found behind school buildings or churches being burned down.    I can't help but think that most of my feelings about family members taking on the responsibility of other family members is cultural.  Yesterday, though, I realized when that mother at the soccer field was so impressed that an aunt came out to a soccer practice that I'm so thankful that my nieces and nephew don't live with me.  I can't imagine taking custody of these kids because my brother was in jail (I would of course, but I can't imagine it).  I just can't even fathom it for my family and yet when a child tells me something like this I don't even flinch.  It seems so normal in the schools I teach in.  I realized yesterday that my desensitization is a bad thing.  It causes complacency and this will never help a child.  But, what can I say for Kindergartener whose role models are in jail that will stay with him and keep him off the streets when he grows up?           "

4192173,male,Technology,"             Since yesterday was Day 1 for the new Hypefactor material, I've decided to keep an ongoing journal about this record so a year from now I can look back and see what this album eventually started as and how much it either changed or stayed on course. Plus I want to see how scattered my brain really is when it comes to doing what I love the most, which is making music.   Day 1 was very productive. Surprisingly actually. It was very casual and the ideas were flowing. The first Hypefactor record started from songs that either Brandt or myself had already written and we would play over what already existed. This time it was starting totally from scratch usually from a simple 4 measure drum or synth loop. Already the sound is different. We've got four tracks in embryonic form and they seem darker, a little depressing, though the last song we started working on was a rocker. I'm interested in seeing that one come together.   Having not written on my own (i.e. not in a band atmosphere or with a producer riding me) in quite some time, it was a pleasure to just sit and play bass. I had spent the last year or so either just doing remixes, writing for Chemlab, or writing with the aggression in the rehearsal space (where Ocionic and Wedding Song were born), so I wasn't sure if I could immediately get back into the swing of writing for myself. However, I was more than ready and never really stopped for a second (other than the customary Wendy's break. thats when you KNOW I'm in the zone). I think it was the same thing for Brandt, who is a lot quicker of an engineer these days. I was jumping from bass to keyboards like a kid who needs ritalin and he kept up withour losing a beat.  Today is day two. I'd like to think we can pump out maybe 2 more. Once we have about 6 ideas down,  I want to start bringing people in to add over this stuff. I hear things and I'll say 'this needs (insert name here)' Last time, we didn't do the guest star thing till later in the process. This time, I want people to be in the early stages to help shape the songs. At the same time, I would like to have different people come in trigger a few new ideas. For example, Robin has guitar piece I want to lay down and Ash has an ambient piece I fell in love in when I accidentally downloaded it off his hotline account. I hope to bring in some non Mogpackers as well some OLD schoolers. We shall see.

589736,male,Technology,"           I am going off of other people's words here, but, supposedly, the Ep II novel discusses spirits (for lack of a better word).  When Anakin has sanpped and is slaughtering the Tuskins, they pan back to Yoda and you here Qui-Gon say 'Anakin! Anakin! NO!!!!'  In the book, Yoda and Windu are puzzled by this, because there has aparently never been an reports of an afterlife or whatever you want to call it.  Taking that, you could assume that Yoda and Obi-Wan figured out how to live on.  Remember, Obi-Wan warns Vader that he will become more powerful than can be imagined.  Now, it does not explain Vader.  Mir - Obi-Wan did not communicate with Luke immediately upon his death, possibly explaining why Yoda did not.  As for sensing Leia, that's easy.  She was not attuned to the Force at that point, masking her from Vader.         "

But it's funny because I really should be so fat right now it's ridiculous, after realizing how much I ate and how much I eat in general, I just don't understand. I had 3 full plates of food at the pasta party. Each totally filled. I finished them all.  PLATE ONE: THE SALAD/BREAD PLATE This plate was traditional and good, but ya I ate all of my salad, all of my fruit, and 3 slices of garlic bread!! Nummy! But hey notice that I did have a salad and fruit, I am staying healthy.  PLATE TWO: THE PASTA PLATE Of course, the whole thing was filled up with pasta. One huge section was of the pesto pasta and the other two both had cheese ravioli. The only bit I did finish on this plate was like 5 ravilois, but trust me when I say I had already eaten like 30.  PLATE THREE: THE DESSERT PLATE Oh man, dessert. Ok so I didn't fill this plate up completely, but well enough. I had 2 little chocolate rice krispie bars, 2 other kind of rice krispie bars, and a chocolate covered peanut butter bar thing. You still have to admit that was a lot.  To think I ate all this in just like 15-30 min. Man. Ya I'm proud to say that I ate 3 times as much as most people on the team. Funny to because at every pasta party Stick and Kathryn always go back to how I had eaten 8 pieces of lasaguna at a pasta party before and how I had eaten a whole cheese bread pizza from Papa John's. Honestly, please tell me why I'm not that fat. Maybe it's because I play sports year round...... haha wow can't wait when that stops. Whoa.   I love how I just spent all this time talking about food and pasta parties while I'm so screwed in my life when it comes to school and hw and when I have an ap us oral tomorrow and a ap us terms quiz thursday with 2 chapters.

In addition to DJS overriding my post (no hard feelings, friend...I just thought I'd tease you), I've had my head slammed into the ground a few times today. (not literally)   1)  Another ass-backwards view from my company: it's more effective and cost-efficient for me to travel to NY and spend thousands of dollars a month to get trained, than for someone within our NY office to learn how to use our web teaching tool. This takes approximately 5 minutes to learn...I know because I've used it before with our clients.  I just don't get it.  Here's the direct quote I got from the head of L&D:  'I just spoke with the trainer and she has no experience with Webex.

2012853,female,indUnk,"       If anyone is wondering, when I say ' there ', I mean that place that you thought you would be in when you were little and wanted to be grown up.  But do you ever get  there ? and what  is it ? Is it finishing high school? finishing Uni? Getting into a relationship?  I'm 23 and I always thought my life would be different to what it is now. I always thought I would have done so much by now, yet sometimes I feel like I've done nothing. I'm not there yet.. when will i get there?  When I was away, in KL, my cous said a funny thing. She was talking about her future (she has youth on her side) and all the things she would have acheived by the time she was 25. A house, a car, a high paying job. I laughed at her, and told her what the world really was like, that I was 23 going on 24 and had no house, a junky car and two lowly paying jobs, and no chance of getting them by the time I hit 25. She looked at me in disbelief as if I was lying to her, and I didn't know what to say. They were so important to her, I guess that was her 'it', her getting 'there' was 'it'.   I know that those things aren't important, maybe if I had them already I would think so, but I would rather not have them and enjoy life as it is for now than wish for something that is far away in the future.  I am dying to get away from this place, and see the world. More than just asia, I'd like to travel to Europe, Africa and America, to see what its like there. here, especially where my parents live, its a suburban existence. I go to the local malls and feel out of place because I don't have a pram with babies in it. Two friends of mine got married last year and that scares me so much. Lots of other people have asked me why, but to me its crystal clear - marriage is cutting yourself off from discovering things in this world, and entering into the 'suburban' part of your life. when you're married there's more than just you, and you sort of disappear into that.  For me, at this stage, I think thats 'it'; not getting caught up in the suburban existence; i'd rather be doing something life changing, for myself, that  I  want. Before that (suburban existence- husband, house and kids) I want to be a traveller and have my own experiences and discoveries, away from everything that is here and that I have always been used to..... and thats  it !!!

4192173,male,Technology,"             Hello again, everyone (all nine of you.) I know it has been some time since I posted here, and you have missed my impersonal musings terribly. You feel neglected. But I swear I will not let it happen again. There are simply too many thrills and wacky misadventures in my life at the moment, and I would be remiss were I to spare you any of the gory details. So here it goes:   hypefactor: part deux  I spent a fair amount of time working on the new hypefactor record during the past month, although I was distracted in recent weeks by school, real life shite and some other musical projects. Most of the guitars are tracked on nine songs, however, and I plan to wrap up writing, production and rough mixing on most of the material by the end of this week. There are also two new songs waiting in the wings - 'Bitter Party Of One' and 'Down To Brass Tacks' - that, for the most part, have yet to be tackled by the team. Both originated from guitar parts I wrote while messing about on other songs, and while they are shamelessly poppy and breezy, I am hoping they make the record. The plan now is to tackle them once we are well underway with tracking live drums, which everyone wants to see happen this month. My fingers are crossed.  We took a bit of a hiatus from work at the Birdcage in late October because F.J. was compelled to make one of his usual pilgrimages to Los Angeles. I gathered Ash and Robin for a session last Tuesday, however, where we reviewed some old parts (such as new guitars for the chaotic 'Solar') and listened to some works in progress. But the bulk of our brief session was dedicated to 'Two Basses Thin,' which had become a thorn in my side as of late.  The song started during one of the June or July sessions with a basic acoustic/bass guitar motif jammed to inifinity, and was later expanded radically when Ash developed a slew of loops for a chorus. The result was somewhat messy in that we were left with two distinct sections that seemed incompatible, the tension between the two exacerbated by F's dense, seven-minute arrangement. The complexity of the thing had me both concerned and flummoxed for some time, and I found myself unable to write anything resembling a workable guitar structure, despite some excellent contributions from Robin and F.J. in the choruses.  The writer's block concerned me enough that I called in Robin and Ash to help me jam around the parts some more and see if the two sections could indeed be linked. At first, Ash also seemed put off by the arrangement, describing it as a 'mess.' I am not certain that he left the studio any less skeptical. But after an hour of playing, we tracked some lovely new E-Bow parts of Robin's and a new bass part of Ash's that seemed to make the transition more seamless. Having those two playing with me also gave me a much better handle on the chord structure, and I have now tracked a bunch of parts (on top of the 40 or so already there) that attempt to blend the verses and choruses melodically. I hope everything else thinks it works, because I still am not certain. We shall see at the end of this week after I have fleshed things out a bit more, assembled a working mix and circulated MP3s amongst the gang.  While I must leave now to write a paper about stress - in Portugese, no less - I will post again tomorrow in greater detail about some other recent work, including the hypefactor and Chemlab remixes, recent gigs (Spiritualized, Echo and The Bunnymen), record purchases (John Cale, Twilight Singers, Suede) and the continuing saga that is the hypefactor sessions. Until then, cheers.         "

I read fiction 99% of the time, but I like non-fiction and poetry too.    2. What is your favorite novel?  It is almost impossible for me to answer that question.  I have so many favorites (ask HAL).  But, if I had to pick one book, I would pick  Moby Dick .    3. Do you have a favorite poem? (Share it!)  Why Regret By Galway Kinnell  Didn't you like the way the ants help the peony globes open by eating off the glue? Weren't you cheered to see the ironworkers sitting on an I-beam dangling from a cable, in a row, like starlings, eating lunch, maybe baloney on white with flourescent mustard? Wasn't it a revelation to waggle from the estuary all the way up the river, the pirle, the kill, the run, the brook, the beck, the sike gone dry, to the shock of a spring? Didn't you almost shiver, hearing the book lice clicking their sexual syncopation inside the old Webster's  New International  - perhaps having just eating out of it  izle, xyster  and  thalassacon ? What did you imagine lay in store anyway at the end of a world whose sub-substance is ooze, gleet, birdlime, slime, mucus, muck? Don't worry about becoming emaciated - think of the wren and how little flesh is needed to make a song. Didn't it seem somehow familiar when the nymph split open and the magfly struggled free and flew and perched and then its own back split open and the imago, the true adult, somersaulted out backwards and took flight toward the swarm, mouth-parts vestigial alimentary canal unfit to digest food, a day or hour left to find the desired one? Or when Cassonova threw the linguine in squid ink out the window, telling his startled companion, 'The perfected lover does not eat.' As a child didn't you find it calming to think  of the pinworms as some kind of tiny batons giving cadence to the squeezes and releases around the downward march of debris? Didn't you once glimpse what seemed your own inner blazonry in the monarchs, wobbling  and gliding, in desire, in the middle air? Weren't you reassured at the thought that these flimsy, hinged beings might navigate their way to Mexico by the flair of the dead bodies of ancestors who fell in the same migration a year ago? Isn't it worth missing whatever joy you might have dreamed, to wake in the night and find you and your beloved are holding hands in your sleep?  [please don't sue me, Galway]   4.

766556,female,indUnk,"        Monday, bah humbug!  If you were to take a look at the past entries for Mondays, you'll see that I am just not a Monday person.  And here we are again.  I had high hopes for another fabulous fun-filled weekend, but all I got was a weekend of being sick and hiding under covers on the sofa.    It started off well enough, with a trip to the salon on Friday afternoon.  Nothing better than an aromatherapy scalp massage and a hairwashing.  Ahh!  Walked out of there feeling all diva-licious, but by the time I got to my office, the humidity had wreaked havoc on my new 'do.  *sigh*  Friday night was lots of fun, with more alcohol than a Diva should consume in one night.  Didn't get out of the bar until 3:30... in the morning.  Sure, that's no big deal for you maybe, but for me... that's practically marathon partying.  I got to play pool, and danced a little and had a genuinely good time.  But I payed for it on Saturday.    That's when the cold that had been threatening to take over finally won.  In my weakened -- or is it weekend *grin* -- condition, the cold conquered all.  I sat motionless on my friend's sofa during a playdate with the little divas, then got into bed around 9pm on Saturday night.  Slept till 2:30pm on Sunday, moved to the sofa, and moved in and out of conciousness the whole day.  Missed my friend's wedding, too.   And today I would really prefer to be back on my sofa, under a blanket.  But, dedicated Diva that I am, I am at work.  I don't know for how long though.  Diva out.          "

4192173,male,Technology,"             Little B has the flu, so the studio is basically contaminated. Thus our Tuesday studio event was out the door. Sissy boy. However, news comes Mattagement that both HF and the aggression have received reviews in the newest issue of Outburn. THE DISTRACTED LOVER, which received an 8 out of 10, was a well written review in which I felt the reviewer gave it a fair shake and actually knew what the hell he was talking about. Most shocking was that his favorite track on the CD, PIRATED, is in fact my least favorite. Meanwhile, the aggression's DEVIATIONS ep got a 6 out of 10 from some reviewer who seemed more hellbent on classifying everything in a genre as opposed to actually getting into details about the music. While the reviewer is very kind to FLOOD as an album, it's shocking at how the two reviews differ. One is well written and really gets into the guts of the CD while the other sounds like some bored kid trying to explain something to a pal in the dorm room. Anyway, its fun to hear opinions like this, especially when they're good. Of course, right when we get reviewed, the label doesn't have an ad in sight for any of these records. No one in the MOGcamp is shocked.  Via the wonderful world of the Internet, Ash has delivered his parts for the second half of the track we call TWO BASSES. As a joke, I call it TWO BASSES THIN. If you get that, you get 10 points. Anyway, I am due in DC this week so I want to take this track with me to really get into it. The first half is slow, this new half is faster. The key to this will be to make a solid transition between the two. I see this at the moment on the second half of the album. (I write that simply so a year from now we can compare where the track actually ends up)  I close the evening reading about Raymond Watt's new project, which is called, and I love this...WATTS. My dear friend Marc Heal appears on this I think. This will give the Kidd and I much enjoyment as we love all things Raymond. I hope it's good. I hope I don't have to order it from Japan. I hope it's awesome. Meanwhile, Bryan Black is going to put out the long-awaited Haloblack album THROB soon. I'm curious how that album will be received by the kids. Louche slipped it to me a while ago. I dig it, its really well done. However, it is not fast, not hard, but unique and interesting. I can hear the douche coldwave kids (not you, Aero) complaining. But kudos to Bryan for expanding his palette. It's a tough sell of a record though. The only thing Coldwave I'm digging thats new is Christ Analogue's new one. That's a hot album.  Watts will probably be awesome. Hopefully  F         "

3359005,male,Student,"             Ok... Here's my blow by blow summary of what happened on the second leg of the race. This week's picture album totally sucked, with no pictures of the tango detour. Very queerly, 50% of the pictures were of the foam party at te 'Shake' place,when on TV they only spent 5 mins there. The poster of the photographs was also crazy, cause Kami & Karli have so many pics when Bob & Joyce have none...  Ok, so you know they were in Uruguay when they stopped. They received the clue to go to the pub 'Shake' in the Uraguaian downtown. The little lady went the wrong way, which I was absolutely pissed at cause Brandon & Nicole were right there for them to follow. The bowling moms surprised me with their navigation skills as they took over Alison & Donny to reach the pub first. Meanwhile, Charla & Mirna chanced upon a hooker!  Amazing Quote at this point(says Mirna to Charla about the hooker): She's pissed now cause we're talking to her when she's got business to do.         And so the teams reached the pub one by one. Brandon & Nicole were the ones victimised by the task, with Nicole getting squeezed in the context of trying to burst her beach ball. Ok... That sounds sick! Ok, yeah! She gets touched and shagged, and for a moment I thought the guy was going to rape her under the foam while Brandon minded his business with the balls. That sounds sick again! Ok... The creepy face in the picture is probably the molester...         From the part house they were supposed to go to the port to take a ferry to Buenos Aires, Argentina. Charla & Mirna missed the ferry. I mean if Charla was normal they'd have missed it. Again... MANIPULATION! The little lady actually used her disability to her advantage again. I have a feelin this is going to be the trend for as long as they are here. She is one power pack... Getting the ferry to wait for the 'Guest of Honour'. Go the little one!  They got to Argentina and had to go to Evita's resting place. It was a cemetery called Recoleta, but a few teams got the wrong cemetery, going to Chacarita, where Evita's Husband, the president, was buried. It is absolutely disrespectful of the producers to make the teams run into the cemetery like that. Oh, and Charla & Mirna caught a buggy which decided it would help a 'little lady'.  Amazing Quote at this point(says Mirna to buggy driver): Little lady here! Little lady here!  And the teams received a clue for the Detour. Yay! In tango, teams had to travel 1.5 miles on any preferred mode of transport to El Tango, where they would receive a picture of one of the dancers. Then, they would have to enter in a horribly lit, beautiful and atmospheric theatre, where a large number of people were doint the tango. Recognise the face. Very difficult in the dim light, but still easier than walking 8 unruly hounds 1 mile. That was of course in Perro! Teams had to deal with hyper active dogs that sometimes were overly horny for their own good. Only Kami & Karli and Bob & Joyce completed this task.  Amazing Quote at this point(says Alison to the dog): You can't keep having sex!         From there, the teams went to a cow farm. What's it with cows this time? First, slaughtered, bloody cows. Then now its alive and fast cows... Oh the irony! Anyway the roadblock clue read: 'The person that's doing this task must have fast hands and fast feet'.   Amazing Quote at this point(says Charla to Mirna): You may have to stick your hand up the cow's ass.  And anyway, the teams did not have to do that. all they had to do was get a bananda off the cow's neck. Luckily Charla didn't step up to stick her hand up the cow's ass cause she would have been trampled to death.         All the blah and teams had to go on a horse carraige to their next pit stop.        Oh yes... Did I mention that Alison and Donny were eliminated? What a shocker. I really don't know what to say after 2 most expected couples got eliminated first... *hums away*         Opinions and views on teams will be posted later tomorrow I kind of tired now...

When was the last time you rememberanything happeneing there, or them doing anything at all in the world? Never.   After Mongolia I started thinking about Portugal. You never hear anything about Portugal either. I can understand Mongolia, it's way the hell out of the way near Siberia. It may even be part of Russia or China these days. But Portugal, man they're right there on the edge of Europe. I never hear anything, and I mean anything about portugal. I remember talking about WWII in school. We leraned that Spain was neutral during the war, we knew about how pretty much every European country stood, every one aside from Portugal. What happened to them, did they just vanish after the age of exploration....has anyone bothered to check!!! Since I'm obviously on the internet right now I know that I  could  just read about these places, but that would be too easy.   I think it's time that T.V. started informing us about countries that it doesn't really talk about already.

I'm not much into the recent (last 20 years) jazz.  As a whole, American attempts at orchestral music (movie soundtracks not included) have been pathetic.  Bernstein had some attempts at 'good' orchestral music (Candide Overture).  Copland was the best American composer in my opinion.  But, you can't beat 'the continent' for good classical music.  From Bach through Beethoven to Tchaikovsky (yeah, Russian, but close enough), they had some incredible talent.  I guess what it comes down to is I will admit that, as a whole, European culture, which is after all what all the things we are talking about make up, is better than American.  Hell, we can't even make a decent beer.  I still prefer living in the heathen US, wearing my holy blue jeans, ratty old t-shirt, eating my cheeseburger, deep fried potatoe strips, and watching American football on TV, or better yet, laughing at some of the ugly dresses the actresses wear to all the awards shows.

This post contains explicit language (which serves to highlight the reality of the situation).*  Today's rude awakening was brought to you by a scruffy pudgy jerk who wouldn't know his right hand from a can of VB if he didn't occasionally have to pick his nose.  There we were, standing on the curb waiting to cross the road like law-abiding pedestrians when a few jaywalkers crossed over to our side. Since there wasn't much room curbside with the crowd waiting for the lights to change, two of them had to squeeze past in the space between me and the shop that sold motorbikes on Elizabeth and A'Beckett.  The third brusqely shoved past me and bumped me aside, then had the audacity to blame me for not moving to accomodate his pudginess.  'Hey!' I said when I felt the push.   'Stupid fucking chink' he said at the same time, as he walked on.  I was stunned, then ranted to Shawn and Charles, 'What an asshole!'  Shawn shouted to the guy's retreating back 'Hey what's the matter with you?'  The Pudge turned around. 'She didn't move outta the way.'  'And that gives you the right to be rude? Have some manners, man' Shawn replied before turning around.  The Pudge advanced towards us enacting acts of bravado you see only on TV, spewing cliches less cornball than 'you wanna piece o' me', and more cheesy than 'bring it on'. Something more akin to the Far East Plaza bengs' call-to-arms of 'Settle!!' while flashing an orange comb with a pointy end.   Shawn turned around and faced him, once again reprimanding him for being rude, as the Pudge defended himself, eloquently stating 'So what?'  'Hey, you were the one that bumped into me ok?' I said. I was ignored.  There they were, two male peacocks in all their fiery glory, fighting for a piece of lost pride, jaws squared, looking at each other straight in the eye, the space between them the width of two fingers.  And I was thinking, where am I in all of this? This isn't some bullshit attention-seeking rant that I'm spouting here, but seriously, if he had a problem, didn't he have it with me as well? After all, wasn't I the stupid fucking chink that got into his Royal Pudginess' way? Did I need Shawn to defend my honour like a frail damsel in distress? Do I need to reminded, even now, that I would have slunk away muttering angrily before the shock of it wore off and I realised I should have retaliated? Or maybe I would have just turned the other cheek, saying I shouldn't bother or sink to their level (and used it as an excuse to hide my fear as I'm wont to do sometimes)?  Shawn just reminded me of the time at Priceline when this skinny bleached blonde teen just stepped on my heels and when I exclaimed 'Ow' she just told me to move my bags from the bench, and all I did was mutter 'Bitch' UNDER MY BREATH. He says we shouldn't let people like this get away with it.  So what should I do? I don't just go quietly, which I used to do last time; now at least I show my disapproval at others' rudeness. But what about setting an example? WWJD? Dammit, sometimes I know what I can do, maybe shout back a cheerful 'thank you for being so niiiice', and 'God loves you'  (and also just to unnerve them), but a scathing comeback's so much easier to take on than love and peace or even a conciliatory nod of 'whatever'. And maybe I just DON'T want to be nice or submissive. Maybe I want to fight my own battles, and show that I can hold my own against the Rude Ones, men or women (but especially men).  As the brilliant plumage of the peacocks began to fold back, Shawn decided to turn around and walk off leaving the Pudge to continue ranting, 'hey we can do this right now, man. Come on...' The Pudge just fudged his battle.  Charles asked what was it the guy had said that sparked the whole episode, and as Shawn replied, a young Aussie couple walking by us told us just to 'ignore that jerk. He doesn't know what he's talking about and unfortunately some Australians are just idiots. Not all of us like that'   We smiled, 'yeah, that's good to know. Thanks'. They smiled back, kindred spirits for awhile.  It takes all kinds, doesn't it? But what do I know? I'm the Other - a  Woman  of  Asian  descent, a small speck in this (post-colonialist patriarchal) world. [Forgive me for indulging in that piece of arty-farty knowledge hehe]  If my primary five teacher Mrs Koh were here, she'd have given him a stern talking to, and washed his mouth out with Dynamo for using such filthy language. That's what we need to keep the streets clean. A stout middle-aged aunty who could hold her own against the young punks of today.   Try calling  her  a stupid effin' chink.    5 January 2003           "

I wish i knew why I let something stupid as a guy get to me, but it does, he does! I know i'm doing better now, I finally try to go out with other guys and well... now HE is in the back of my mind. When i see him, he is just another face in the crowd. He is not what I want, He doesnt like the outdoors, I love it and need a guy that will love that with me. He doesnt like to get dirty, I'd love to mudd wrestle with a guy someday, hopefully not just hopes of him falling will happen, but he will be falling emotionally too, for me! HE doesnt like animals, Animals are my life, eventually and hopefully my career. He hates the government, i want to marry into the military and one day work as a civilian on an Air Force Base. By pointing out all of what we dont have in common, well, each time i let go, peice by peice, because i know, hes not what im looking for. He doesnt speek his mind, he doesnt let me know. I want someone, who is comfortable in their skin, and they know to an extent want they want. I want someone who will never give up, and always push harder no matter what. I want an athlete to keep up with me, because everyone knows the hassle that I can be. Mr. Perfect or semi at that, maybe not perfect at all, but was meant for me, where are you! when will we finally be? are you here, or farther along the road? i'm willing to wait, because i know when i find you, i'll finally be happy.. for now, im just out for casual dating, because when we finally meet, you will stand out from the rest and it will be an unexplainable experience.. i just cant wait. till im finally there with you. No longer will pain and love go hand in hand.. you will erase that from my system, and show me what love is.  I am such a romantic but yet, you see the tough me! the one who can probably kick your ass, no I know I can kick your ass... Im Mayra and no one messes with me.... I've always held my own and&nbsp; I know who I am and what I can be. No guy will ever take that away, good or bad. I know ME!        "

What does it say in the signature line of your emails?    Don't have one.  We probably have the oldest version ever of Lotus Notes here at work, and there's actually not the capability.  But in all honesty, I think they're a bit pretentious.  Plus, I never understood why people put their e-mail addresses in them.  Aren't you already sending the person an e-mail?  Don't get it.   2. Did you have a senior quote in your high school yearbook? What was it? If you haven't graduated yet, what would you like your quote to be?   I used a weird Chinese proverb: 'Do not use a hatchet to kill a fly on your friend's forehead.'  Don't ask me why.   3. If you had vanity plates on your car, what would they read? If you already have them, what do they say?   I remember when my little brother slaved over what he wanted on his plates.  He eventually settled on 'MUEGLFN' (Marquette University Eagle Fan.)  What a chach.  I would probably choose MNKYLVR or U24EVAH.   4. Have you received any gifts with messages engraved upon them? What did the inscription say?   I got a pen for high school graduation with my name on it.  Dumb gift.   5. What would you like your epitaph to be?

589736,male,Technology,"            &nbsp;EDUCATION AND EXPERIENCE:    LAW ENFORCEMENT:I was arrested in Kennebunkport, Maine, in 1976 for driving under the influence of alcohol. I pled guilty, paid a fine, and had my driver's license suspended for 30 days. My Texas driving record has been 'lost' and is not available.   MILITARY:I joined the Texas Air National Guard and went AWOL. I refused to take a drug test or answer any questions about my drug use. By joining the Texas Air National Guard, I was able to avoid combat duty in Vietnam.   COLLEGE:I graduated from Yale University with a low C average. I was a cheerleader.   PAST WORK EXPERIENCE:I ran for U.S. Congress and lost. I began my career in the oil business in Midland, Texas, in 1975. I bought an oil company, but couldn't find any oil in Texas. I bought the Texas Rangers baseball team in a sweetheart deal that took land using taxpayer money. With the help of my father and our right-wing friends in the oil industry (including Enron CEO Ken Lay), I was elected governor of Texas.   ACCOMPLISHMENTS AS GOVERNOR OF TEXAS:I changed Texas pollution laws to favor power and oil companies, making Texas the most polluted state in the Union. During my tenure, Houston replaced Los Angeles as the most smog-ridden city in America. I cut taxes and bankrupted the Texas treasury to the tune of billions in borrowed money. I set the record for the most executions by any governor in American history. With the help of my brother, the governor of Florida, and my father's appointments to the SupremeCourt, I became President after losing by over 500,000 votes.   ACCOMPLISHMENTS AS PRESIDENT:I am the first President in U.S. history to enter office with acriminal record.&nbsp; I invaded and occupied two countries at a continuing cost of over one billion dollars per week.   ECONOMY:I spent the U.S. surplus and effectively bankrupted the U.S. Treasury. I shattered the record for the largest annual deficit in U.S. history. I set an economic record for most private bankruptcies filed in any 12-month period. I set the all-time record for most foreclosures in a 12-month period. I set the all-time record for the biggest drop in the history of the U.S. stock market.In my first year in office, over 2 million Americans lost their jobs and that trend has continued for the majority of my time in office.   CABINET: I'm proud that the members of my cabinet are the richest of any administration in U.S. history. My 'poorest millionaire,' Condoleeza Rice, has a Chevron oil tanker named after her. I set the record for most campaign fund-raising trips by a U.S. President. I am the all-time U.S. and world record-holder for receiving the most corporate campaign donations.   PRIVILEGE: My largest lifetime campaign contributor, and one of mybest friends, Kenneth Lay, presided over the largest corporate bankruptcy fraud in U.S. history, Enron. My political party used Enron private jets and corporate attorneys to assure my success with the U.S. Supreme Court during my election decision. I have protected myfriends at Enron and Halliburton against investigation or prosecution. More time and money was spent investigating the Monica Lewinsky affair than has been spent investigating one of the biggest corporate rip-offs in history.   CORRUPTION:I presided over the biggest energy crisis in U.S. historyand refused to intervene when corruption involving the oil industry was revealed.&nbsp; I presided over the highest gasoline prices in U.S. history. I changed the U.S. policy to allow convicted criminals to be awarded government contracts. I appointed more convicted criminals to administration than any President in U.S. history.   FOREIGN RELATIONS: I created the Ministry of Homeland Security, the largest bureaucracy in the history of the United States government. I've broken more international treaties than any President in U.S. history.&nbsp; I am the first President in U.S. history to have the United Nations remove the U.S. from the Human Rights Commission. I withdrew the U.S. from the World Court of Law. I refused to allow inspectors access to U.S. 'prisoners of war' detainees and thereby have refused to abide by the Geneva Convention. I am the first President in history to refuse United Nations election inspectors (during the 2002 U.S. election).   ACCESS:I set the record for fewest number of press conferences of any President since the advent of television. I set the all-time record for most days on vacation in any one-year period. After taking off the entire month of August, I resided over the worst security failure in U.S. history.   WORLD IMAGE: I garnered the most sympathy for the U.S. after the World Trade Center attacks and less than a year later made the U.S. the most hated country in the world, the largest failure of diplomacy in world history. I have set the all-time record for most people worldwideto simultaneously protest me in public venues (15 million people), shattering the record for protest against any person in the history of mankind. I am the first President in U.S. history to order an unprovoked, pre-emptive attack and the military occupation of a sovereign nation. I did so against the will of the United Nations, the majority of U.S. citizens, and the world community. I have cut health care benefits for war veterans and support a cut in duty benefits foractive duty troops and their families -- in wartime.   MILITARY INTELLIGENCE: In my State of the Union Address, I lied about our reasons for attacking Iraq, then blamed the lies on our British friends. I am the first President in history to have a majority of Europeans (71%) view my presidency as the biggest threat to world peace and security. I am supporting development of a nuclear 'Tactical Bunker Buster,' a WMD. I have so far failedto fulfill my pledge to bring Osama Bin Laden to justice.   RECORDS AND REFERENCES:  All records of my tenure as governor of Texas are now in my father's library, sealed and unavailable for public view. All records of SEC investigations into my insider trading and my bankrupt companies are sealed in secrecy and unavailable for public view.

766556,female,indUnk,"        One man's trash...  is another man's treasure, so they say (whoever 'they' are).  I had a threesome of this yesterday, so I figured it earned a place in blog history.  First, I had a client call to ask about a local magazine that we recieve here at the hotel regularly for our guests.  It has Pamela Anderson on the cover of its 10th Anniversary Issue (January 03), and he knows someone in Kid Rock's band who can get Pamela to autograph it for him.  It was such a big deal for him that I promised to do my best and get my hands on two of them as he asked.   Turns out, all I had to do was walk down to our Housekeeping department and ASK.  We have tons of them.    So, off they went to my guest up north, and he's so very grateful and what can he do to repay me?  Well, he's a jewelry broker, so I'm sure we'll think of something.  *sparkle-sparkle*  Then, there was the request at daycare posted to the door upon entering.  Please bring in three empty film canisters and an empty tissue box.  Trash, that I would keep lying around just for such instances.  Actually, I just threw a tissue box away last Friday, and I left 3 film canisters at my mother-in-law's house over the weekend to get the film inside developed.  The children are making instruments - except for mine of course, because I threw all of that stuff away!  And then there was the binder I found tucked away on a shelf yesterday.  I use lots of binders at work -- lots of 'em.  I need a new 2 inch binder to replace an old 2 inch binder that has busted out of its 2 inches.  So, I went to remove one from a shelf that's been sitting there unnoticed for who know's how long.  I check with my office mates to make sure it's OK I take this particularly lovely 2 inch binder for my own.  All of a sudden, one of my colleagues decides that the information inside could be valuable to him, and please don't use THAT binder.  And as it turned out, he started using the info in that binder today and it has been very useful indeed.  Go figure.  Diva out.         "

3869393,female,Technology,"       Well, this was supposed to be my blog for yday but due to the pausity of the computer, last evening, I couldnt upload this. &nbsp; As usual, I had to fight for the computer, but then for a change I lost the fight this time around.&nbsp; Hmm...wonder if this is a new trend...hope not! &nbsp; So what was my sunday like, well, I guess this is how my sunday's are probably going to be spent by me for a few more months...haha! &nbsp; Woke up at 6am, and had to wash my hair...couldnt wash it on saturday coz it was amavasya, sooooo many rules!!! Anyway, once that ordeal was over, I had to rush and get ready for our temple trip.&nbsp; This weekend was&nbsp;more focussed on temples around Chennai.&nbsp; Todays' trip was to Kanchipuram.&nbsp; Quite a nice place, known as the temple town, it kindof lost a lot of its shine as the temple town and is now the official saree capital!&nbsp;  &nbsp; But then, the temples are still among the best and most beautiful ones.&nbsp; First, in the series of temples was at this place called Tirupakozhi.&nbsp; This is a very nostalgic temple for my family as this is the place where my maternal grandma came over, offered some prayers and after which my uncle was concieved.&nbsp; Infact my uncle is named after this temple deity, Vijayaraghavan.&nbsp;&nbsp; This particular temple has a tradition where women who are unable to concieve, take a dip in the tank at the temple premises, collect some green gram, roast it and then bundle it in a moist muslin cloth and have it placed on their tummy and knotted up.&nbsp; As normal scientific knowledge would say, once roasted, the pulse should not sprout, but as per the tradition here, this pulse will sprout if the woman is blessed by the deity, Managathavalli Thaiyar.&nbsp; Quite strange as it sounds, but since I have seen a few cases comes thro with this, I dont have much choice but to believe in the same. &nbsp; Next stop was a temple called Yadotkara.&nbsp; This is a strange temple, coz it has a lot of relation with a temple down south near Kumbakonam.&nbsp; The lord is supposed to have got angry at one of the kings and come to this place.&nbsp; Here he grants his devotee a set of wishes, so the lord here is called Sunna Vannukm Perumal.&nbsp; Amazing Andal here, really quite gorgeous a deity. &nbsp; Next Stop was at this place within Kanchipuram, called Tupur, this is the place where Vendanta Desikar is supposed to have been born and initiated his religious discourse.&nbsp; Yet, another beautiful temple with an amazing explaination.&nbsp; Here is the place where I learnt the meaning of Kanchi puram - Bhrama's home, and the meaning of Rameshwaram - meeting place of rama and Shiva, and the meaning of Kasi - the meeting of Light and Bhrama. &nbsp; We were to close the trip with a stop at Varadaraja Temple, but courtesy of some guy jumping into the temple tank, the temple doors were being closed as we entered the temple.&nbsp; Anyway, this temple I guess wasnt in our agenda for the trip, so no problem, will be visited in the next round. &nbsp; Then came lunch at 13:30, was feeling too full and droggy, think the medication which Iwas on was taking effect.&nbsp; So, just had a milkshake and tried to settle my stomach.&nbsp; The weather was quite bad yday and our drive back was made miserable with the innumerable broken and patched roads. &nbsp; Once I reached home, it had to be rest and relaxation time.&nbsp; So, ola, DVD time.&nbsp; This evening, it was a movie called ' save the last dance '.&nbsp; I think I am hooked to movies which revolve around dance and music.&nbsp; I think my interest in dance is on the up and probably I need to join back my dance classes and add some spice or shall I say salsa/ jive&nbsp;to my life. Nice movie, since I enjoyed the music, dance and ofcourse the story was built up decently. &nbsp; Later in the evening, it was off to the club, where to my surprise I got to watch the cricket match on a giant screen.&nbsp; Yeah, the match was lousy and I guess was lost in the first few overs of India's innings.&nbsp; Got back home by 10, and hit the bed...wasnt feeling too well..think all the medication is now starting to go ahead of me..and drain me out...anyway, here's hoping my stomach gets to normality soon.&nbsp; Its quite a pain to lose one's appetite especially when you love food. &nbsp;          "
1708471,female,indUnk,"           It's almost like getting crushed by a semi, but not die. You just lay there in pain, struggling, but you can't do anything about it. It all depends on someone else to help you get through it, to live.   I seriously don't know how else to explain how I've been feeling lately. The only thing I can help myself with is doing somewhat well on tests aka studying and trying to be happy and having a positive outlook. Everything else though is out of my hands, out of my control. I feel like almost every hard situation I'm in right now all depends on someone else. Whether it's a ref during a game, a writer for my page, or just an indecisive friend. With that I can hardly help the situations, I can't make them better at all, sure for some things I can try, but others I can only make them worse. It doesn't help that I'm controlling and have no paticence for things to just work out.    I feel like I need to change myself now, honeslty. I feel like it's come down to the point where I just need to change. But the funny part is I can't, it's how I am and I've been like this my whole life. I have been emotional with every aspect in my life, no matter the situation, and more than ever, that's starting to get me in trouble. I don't like being so emotional, it just ruins things and my attitude, but people need to realize that I can't just change on the spot. And it frusturates me even more to know that I can barely help myself right now.   I feel completely helpless because I can't do anything. I can't express myself with anything I do because it always comes out the wrong way or it comes out too aggressive. I can't get what I want, at all. What hurts me the most is that I can't play my game, I can't play my game of lacrosse without feeling critized and I can't even play my game of life without getting hurt.   I don't know what I need, maybe I just need to stop. But it's so hard to just sit and watch while the world passes me by. I'm in a constant position while everyone else seems to progress. I need people to help me in the situations I can't help and I need people to help me control my emotions. Mostly though, I need to feel like I have control of at least one aspect of my life right now because nothing seems to fit, nothing is in my hands. I know things work out all on their own and you have to just wait for it, but it's been too long, I just wish things would work out for themselves right now. I'm completely helpless and that's all I can say.   Kati         "
2844168,female,Marketing,"                  Phase 2   So I'm feeling a little thoughtful today. I suppose that's what happens when I spend a couple days by myself and it's raining.  Ked and I are at a new place in our life, and I don't just mean our move to Florida. For the past six and a half years, it's like we've been moving through Phase 1. We grew into adulthood together, developed an unbelievably sound marriage relationship, worked through bitterness toward God and church, and learned to love and experience God 'outside the box.' We discovered and honed the skills for our career paths, finished our degrees, and searched our hearts for what role ministry would play in our lives. Through it all, we were searching, searching, searching. What plan does God have for our lives? What if we miss it? We've often been told what a dynamic team we are, and that haunted us. We don't want to be viewed, especially by God, as people who have so much potential. We want to LIVE to our fullest potential. At times we felt as if God was hiding, or maybe our faith wasn't big enough, or sometimes that He just wasn't listening. We prayed, we cried, we vented, and always searched to know God's plan, His truth and His wisdom.  And then all the sudden, it happened. Phase 1 closed with a bang. We graduated, took a missions trip and fulfilled a three year dream to move here. It was a time that was so big, only God could have done it.  As we transitioned into Phase 2 we learned how weak our faith was. Along the way the questions continued to haunt us, but slowly, we continued to grow and God began to answer. Dreams started to be fulfilled, and God continued to give us glimpses of Him. It's amazing. It's scary. The responsibility sometimes frightens me. But the fears began to wash away and the tide dropped peace onto the shore.   Today as I was thinking through all of this again, I hopped onto the website of our friends at  urlLink RBC Ministries.  The reading for  urlLink today's Daily Bread  confirmed what I have begun to realize. God doesn't hide from those who truly seek Him. They quoted from  urlLink Proverbs 2:1-6   3 if you call out for insight  and cry aloud for understanding,  4 and if you look for it as for silver  and search for it as for hidden treasure,  5 then you will understand the fear of the LORD  and find the knowledge of God.  6 For the LORD gives wisdom,  and from his mouth come knowledge and understanding.   We've been crying, even pleading. God WANTS to give understanding and knowledge of Him and His plan for us. He doesn't play games. It will come with time, and there’s no rush. I’ve come to realize it will take my whole life to figure out all that God has in store, and for once I’m just enjoying the journey as He reveals a little bit more each day. It’s a nice place to be.                "

Laura --ha ha!&nbsp; the substance of the Collective!&nbsp; you are who I turn to when I need an objective opinion, and when I need somebody to tell me the cold hard truth.&nbsp; I value that in you, and I hope you are never too shy to do that for somebody.&nbsp; I love your random obsessions (yeah, Jack Kerouac!), and the way you have no desire to conform.&nbsp; You are a true individual.&nbsp; You just don't accept the 'norm' and you don't advertise that.&nbsp; You don't need people to know how much of an individual you are, you just are, and I thank you for that.&nbsp; Your honesty is refreshing.   Geoff --oh, my love.&nbsp; my first in many different respects, my only in others.&nbsp; you probably know more about me than any other person on earth, and that is not something I take lightly.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;hope you know the trust that entails.&nbsp; You have such wonderful ideals.&nbsp; I know sometimes I don't take you seriously, or I try to prove you wrong.&nbsp; Just know that there will always be people like me out there.&nbsp; But if you can ignore them the way you've ignored me, you may just stand a chance of fulfilling your dreams.&nbsp; When you are mad at me, I hope you will refer back to the message I wrote in your yearbook this past year, because all of it is true, and will NEVER change.&nbsp; I love you.   Monkey --the completing member of the Collective!&nbsp; and my big little brother!&nbsp; Don't forget, that means &nbsp;I will always have the power to a) get you to tell me anything about your personal life, b) tell you if you're being a jerk, or if you are completely right&nbsp; c) make fun of your gaming ways!&nbsp; ha ha!&nbsp; I hope you remember that whatever my status with Geoff, I'll always love you like the little bro I never had.   Gareth --you were the second friend I made at high school.&nbsp; that puts you in the comfortable position of oldest friend excluding elementary school.&nbsp; (besides when you're an adult, elementary school just doesn't count, and besides, I never hang out with my elementary school buddies anymore!)&nbsp; you, of course, hold the title of wackiest friend, and how I value you for all your frog-loving, fairy dress-wearing, Mel-dating ways!&nbsp; for sure you are one of my very best friends!&nbsp; *oh yeah, and I'm sorry I grabbed your crotch when I was drunk!&nbsp; no gaurantees on it not happening again! ;)*   Mel --my Melly! obviously my best friend that goes to another school (tied with Barbara).&nbsp; definitely the best dancer I know.&nbsp; Probably one with the best realistic ideals.&nbsp; Did you know you are the very first person who has ever spent the night at my house?&nbsp; crazy, huh?&nbsp; you're so much fun, and I love your sense of humour.&nbsp; you are definitely such an awesome friend to have, cause you're not afraid of telling me the truth about my problems.&nbsp; Even if I don't really listen to you! *blush blush!*&nbsp; You're also one of only three&nbsp;of my close friends who has had sex that wasn't with me!&nbsp; that deserves recognition all by itself!&nbsp; ha ha!&nbsp; *k, that made me sound like a slut!*   Barbara --oh, Barb.&nbsp; what can I possibly say about you?&nbsp; how bout that you are totally randomly awesome!&nbsp; if I went to your school, and saw you more often you'd probably be my very best friend.&nbsp; I understand your personality, and you understand mine, which is a big thing with me.&nbsp; It doesn't happen too often.&nbsp; You, and Mel (not the Collective interestingly enough) deal with those children I live with the best.&nbsp; I vow to increase the amount of time I spend with you by fifty percent in the next school year.&nbsp; If I fail to do this, you can torture me on the rack.&nbsp; Is it a deal?   Devin --hey, babe!&nbsp; you are an interesting species of friend to me, because you have always been the guy I can flirt with, with no consequence.&nbsp; You are, and will always be my first-choice dancing partner! You're the guy with whom I can talk about things that my other guy friends just don't understand, like clothes.&nbsp; (gotta love pinstripe!)&nbsp; I dunno, maybe it's a function of your sexuality, maybe it's the fact that you're an image-conscious person.&nbsp; Either way, I value it, and I thank you for it.&nbsp; Don't ever change, EVER, k, Dev, cause I love you exactly the way you are.   Kevin --Kevin, rest assured you are the most well-spoken, and glib of my friends! the rate at which enormous, and surprisingly coherent words&nbsp;flow from your mouth is truly astonishing, and believe me it can make some of the best sources of amusement for me.&nbsp; I love that you have weird and obscure interests, and I'm sorry, Irish Pipe is THE best instrument in the world.&nbsp; Drummers have the best reputation pop culturally as instrumentalists (come on, when you think drummer, what image pops into your mind?&nbsp; I think Travis from Blink 182.&nbsp; very sexy!) but the instrument they play is just not sufficiently awesome&nbsp;to qualify as the best instrument in the world.&nbsp; Anyways...back to you!&nbsp; I have some of the best conversations with you, and your van is for sure a road trip vehicle (not me!&nbsp; nobody rides me all day and all night!&nbsp; NOBODY!)&nbsp; hopefully there are some really great p-tays, and memories to come before you leave for Taiwan.   Brad --Hey Brad!&nbsp; I haven't hung out with you over the five years of high school as as much as I should have.&nbsp; You're a great person to hang with, and believe me, there was a helluvalotta reason (what a fun word!) for me to like you.&nbsp; For instance you are probably one of the MOST talented person I know at what you do.&nbsp; I love your songs, and I really love to watch you play one of the myriad of instruments you know how to play.&nbsp; You're very thoughtful, and obviously can hold up your end of a conversation with Kevin (seeing as how you've been best friends with him for a long time)&nbsp; the way I sometimes can't.&nbsp; I hope the best for you, Brad, whatever that is; you definitely deserve it!   Caitlin --you, my dear, are the VERY FIRST person I made friends with at high school.&nbsp; From finding out about our mutual interest in Mercedes Lackey, to playing non-competetive volleyball in Nicola's backyard a little while ago, you've been such an awesome friend, and have been one for such a long time.&nbsp; You're the most athletic of my friends (no contest!)&nbsp; and, enviously, the hottest.&nbsp; I'm so happy you've gotten what you wanted with Josh, and am impatiently awaiting the details!&nbsp; (can anybody say girl sleepover at Laura's!)&nbsp; I hope I know you for much longer than the last year of high school we have left.   Nicola --hey, girl!&nbsp; you're my dancing friend!&nbsp; you're definitely better that me at ballet, and I love to talk to you about dance.&nbsp; It's so much fun to hear about your latest celebrity crushes, and to watch a scary movie with you and watch you gasp and scream.&nbsp; The Ring will always be the scariest movie in the world, and I'm glad I watched it for the first time with you!&nbsp; You've always been the granola factor and yes...you always will be.&nbsp; But never fret!&nbsp; That's a good thing!&nbsp; You and your disapproval of my language and conduct (dirty bubbles!) will keep me in line for years to come, I hope!   Kourtenay --Kourtenay, maybe I haven't spent as much time with you as I should have.&nbsp; I don't know why I haven't, because making that movie with you in tenth grade was absolutely tons and tons of fun.&nbsp; (yeah, Chinese store owner!&nbsp; Making you Death with makeup was certainly my esthetic triumph.&nbsp; what do you say? film and television makeup artist?).&nbsp; All those original parties from so long ago, with LCD, and makeovers, and the card game. (who would you rather give a blow job to?&nbsp; A) Jake, B) Mr. Jossul, or C) Brendan???&nbsp; ha ha!)&nbsp; those were so much fun, and will always be fond memories of an innocent time never to return, a time spent with you.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  if you don't see your name here, it's not cause you're not in my heart.&nbsp; my excuse is that, in the interest of time, I included only my closest friends.&nbsp; I love you all, though, and you know who you are!

She was 5 years old, skinny with blond hair and brown eyes.  We were beautiful together, the little girl version of yin and yang.  “Let’s go together,” one of us said.  So we raced to the upstairs bathroom, got ready and sat down together to pee.  We were giddy.  This was silly.  We were peeing together, our tiny bottoms sharing one toilet.  Our mothers thought it was precious.  This was our cousin thing, a little girl bonding time.  One mother grabbed a camera and flashed our picture, B. with her long blond hair and legs together facing the bathtub, me with my long brown hair and legs together facing the wall.

It is one of my favorite pictures, B. and I concocting a simple plan to kill two birds with one stone.  I’m so glad there is a picture of that innocent time.  Sometimes B. and I will talk about our childhoods, how we grew up so differently yet share so much in common.  She is my blond size 2 cousin.  I am not her.  She is a modified hippie.  I am an ex-sorority girl.  Her mom is young and the least neurotic of her sisters.  My mom is not.  But we both have a factor in our blood that causes blood clots.  So do our mothers.  We are so different and so similar.  I am proud of her, that she is a brilliant photographer.  I love that she loves her animals and plants like they are her children.  I’m glad she has found a man in a fairytale way, which we always dreamed would happen.  I love that she is strong and kind and knows more than she tells.  And I love that sometimes she will say, with laughter in her voice, “Anna, we use to pee together!”  “I know,” I say, laughing back, “I know.”         "

Sorry to those people, because I've just been so touched by the song 'I Believe', and I'm gonna right about the finale of a phase in my life, and the beginning of another.  My dear friends would know that today was my last day at a place that I've detested and cursed for 2 years; the Boarding School. As I lay on my bed, the one that always seemed so uncomfortable at night but so appealing in the day, I heard the sound of something bead like falling on the floor. I looked in between the gape of the bed and the wall, and there was this glass star, the star that I had recieved on my first week here. I felt it extremely appropriate that I got the star back at the start of a new chapter in my life.  Enoch and Ken Wei helped to carry my stuff down, and him waving as my car went off reminded me of the ending of the movie 'Big Fish', where the characters of the persons life waved him his last goodbye, without any tears, but instead with joy.

3034755,male,Internet,"             Today I watched the public opinion concerning to child labour in the country. I learnt that most of the people are against the child labour and all are emphasizing on children education rather than forced labour. Of course, I agree that, eduction is first rights of any child. But what I think is children who are doing hard labour are forced to work for themseleves. They get involved in such act due to poverty and responsiblity towards their parents & their youngers. Most of such children are from those backgrounds, where they have to support their home.  Now next part is - people exclaims that government should look after such act and ban child labour and forced work. They should be admited to school for education. The point is, if they don't work, how they could manage to make money for food, cloths and shelther?  People futher adds that government should facilitate expenses to educate them. I still agree that the only sector that could solve this problem is - government who is responsible for protecting this human rights. Now, again the question is - how could government arrange such budget untill and unless you pay tax to the government? Our tax is the only source of income to the government, which is how they expedite money in country's development.  So, I guess that, root cause of this problem and solution starts from each citizen. If we are loyal to the government system, I am sure such activities can be eradicated from the country within next 10 years of period.           "
589736,male,Technology,"           Before I get to my question, let me preface this by saying that I am not trying to start an argument or change anyone's mind on this issue, because I know that there is nothing that I can say to do so and there is nothing any of you can say to change my mind.  Today a federal judge ruled a Virginia law passed last year (I think) outlawing the so called partial birth abortion procedure as unconstitutional.  I don't know the specifics of his ruling or what the law says, and that is not my question.  What I do not understand is under what situation is the pregnant woman's life in danger enough to end the pregnancy but not enough that it is 'safe' to undergo as much of the birth process as this does.  I use safe in quotes because nothing about the birthing process is without danger.  As much as doctors know, they still don't understand all the vagaries of child birth.  Please don't respond with a flame, because I have not desire to argue this issue, merely to have someone fill me in on something I may be missing about this particular procedure.         "

766556,female,indUnk,"        A new friend  My girls don't get visitors at our house very often.  Once we had a pool party to celebrate the end of summer and four girls came over.  That was a lot of fun and it kept both of my girls entertained for the entire afternoon.  Last night we had another such special occasion.  Kala has teamed up for a pumpkin decorating project at school, so Jenny came home with us after school yesterday.  What a great time we all had decorating two pumpkins and turning it all into a jester with a miniature puppet of himself.  Kala and Jenny came up with the idea and I added my idea of the puppet.  Two pumpkins stacked on top of each other with a mini-me stuck onto a chopstick, jutting out from the bottom pumpkin.  It really turned out nicely.  What was the nicest of all though, was working with the girls to put it all together.  And then, having all three girls running around the house, chasing each other, blowing bubbles and creating general havoc.  We had such a good time together.  And on a school night!  Jenny was trying to convince her mother that she needed to sleep over Sunday night just so the two of them could carry the pumpkin into class together on Monday morning.  Mom wasn't buying it.    Kala has such nice friends; I hope she gets to come over and play again soon.  Diva out.         "
766556,female,indUnk,"        About my yoga  Some weeks back, someone visited my site and requested that I blog about my yoga practice.  Not sure why, and when I said I would blog about my practice, I never really was sure that I would.    But, lately my practice has increased and, combined with my meditation practice, I am beginning to see some changes in how I do what I do ~ at least in yoga anyway.  I've started getting up earlier, like around 6:30 (without an alarm clock - does this mean I'm getting older?); I'm up with the sun for some strange reason.  Sometimes I just roll over and snooze for another hour, but more often I am getting up and rolling out my yoga mat.  The mornings are harder for me than the evenings.  I'm stiff and sore and weak and hungry.  But by the third or fourth sun salutation, I'm better.  I only get through the standing half of the asthanga practice - normally about 20 or 30 minutes worth.  Then I'm primed and ready for the day, with a bit more energy and optimism than expected.  Evenings are better for me.  I can really get deep into the practice when the girls are asleep.  I can hear my breathing and feel the muscles stretching, feel the vibrations that come when I'm in certain positions.  And, now with meditation added to the practice, I realize even more that yoga is a moving meditation.  Sitting with my eyes closed or staring out into space, my body remembers what movement is like.  Moving through an asana, my mind remembers what spaciousness is.    It is strange, and maybe I'm the only one who will ever understand this entry.  But, I was asked to write about it, and its part of my experience.  And, let's face it ~ this  is   my  blog.  Diva out.         "

4192173,male,Technology,"             Day 2 of the new Hypefactor sessions were again productive and successful. The rocker I mentioned yesterday has developed nicely. It now has a hard chorus and some sweet wah wah guitars. Upon reviewing the material so far, which is now up to 5 songs worth, I'm noticing a Joy Division undertone to it. Not in an obvious way, like say, with Interpol, but more  in modern context. At the end of the day, we pinpointed what additions are going to be needed for these songs, and that is mostly some guitar work. Once that is done, hopefully before my next LA jaunt this month, I will then take the songs and begin arranging. While thinking ahead, I realize that we need to quicken the pace with the second batch of songs. I want it to move a bit faster in places. But this is all embryonic, but the melodies are strong and so far it's a real big step forward. It was fun just sitting there reading NME while saying 'yes' or 'no' to potential drum loops. Rough, innit?  I am sickened by the news reports of terrorism at a rock festival in Moscow. I think it's no secret that MOGpac is very pro-Russia and the thought of such violence in that part of the world, especially after having just played there, effects all of us. The fact that this was an act of violence against kids at a rock concert makes this even worse.  The day ended with G and I checking out TERMINATOR 3. I was shocked at how intentionally goofy it was. Arnold is given tons of one-liners, and most are quite funny, but it takes you right out of the drama. Its hard to take seriously. It's also Cameron By Numbers. It's entertaining, but it doesn't really add anything new to that universe. The Birdinator (as I call her), is just a normal hot blonde. Nothing special, so you never accept her as a threat. I see birds like this in LA all the time. When they introduced Robert Patrick in T2, he was unusual looking and you never saw these FX before. Now its just some actress and the same FX. They needed to find an otherworldly knockout who looks like no one else, sorta like Angelina Jolie when you first saw her. The one positive was that the guy who plays John Connor, who I believe is Nick Stahl, is a million times better than that crackhead Ed Furlong, who I doubt could have carried this movie the way Stahl does. The movie was fun for sure, but Cameron ain't losing any sleep.  Though I am. Back to the Lab tomorrow. I think.  F          "

I didn't really over-do it last night, it's more that I mixed things up.  A lesson you think I would've learned when I was 16 - if you're drinking beer, just stick to it.  Don't play the hero and down a mixed drink and then some cider and then back to beer.  The drinking definitely intensified when U2 lost (*sniff, sniff*) their oscar to the flash-in-the-pan Eminem.

1103575,female,indUnk,"       Ms. Hernon is my Algebra II teacher.  She's probably in her fifties, and looks kind of severe, at first glance anyway, but I'll talk more about that later.  She has salt and pepper hair that never has a single strand out of place.  A lot of people in our class are a little bit afraid of her because she gives people 'evil-eye glares' and says things like, 'If one more person tries to tell me {blah blah blah} then I think I'm going to slit my wrists.' {She's funny like that.} But:  I think she's probably one of the better teachers I've had at STA.  And if given a second glance I think she's kind of cute, she has the most interesting sense of humor, and she genuinely cares about how her students are doing. {It  is  possible she's just been in a pretty good mood the past couple of days and she's left a good impression on me.}    No one knows if she's married or not... I've even heard rumors she was in the Peace Corps.  She orders clothes online while we're taking tests, and her toenails are painted pink. {It's kind of hard to imagine Ms. Hernon going to get a pedicure, or even painting her own toenails.}   A couple months ago she was teaching us about 'depressed polynomials'.  When she announced this topic, she turned from the board, and with a slight smile she said,'Now girls, this has nothing to do with the mental state of the numbers.'  It is a sign of how afraid the girls in our class are of her, that I was the only one who laughed.  Today, we were going over some of our problems from homework last night, and we all were exclaiming about how we had all made the same mistake. Ms. Hernon interrupted us from her desk and said, 'Well this would be one case where majority does  not  rule.'  For me, math has Never been a forte.  I didn't learn my times tables until something like 7th grade.  Because I was impeded by this, I didn't do well in my math classes, and I decided I hated them.  My feelings toward mathmatics have become a little less vehement since I've been at STA, but I still don't always look forward to climbing the stairs to the second floor of Donnelly, where the math classes are.  At the moment, I am not exactly excelling in algebra, so today I went to ask Ms. Hernon what I have been doing wrong.  Even I had been a little afraid of going to her one-on-one to ask for help, but I mustered up all of my courage, and dived into her classroom.  She knew exactly what I needed to do {I haven't been studying properly.} and she helped me figure out how to fix that problem.  She was genuinely concerned with my grade, and told me several times how she knows I'm completely capable of doing well in her class.  It always helps to know that your teacher thinks your competent {maybe even intellegent.}  I've already written a lot about Mr. Thomas, and there are several other teachers here who really have made a difference, not just in my education, but in  how I view myself.  Magistra Rowland, my Latin teacher is moving to St. Louis this summer, and I'm really upset because she would have been the only teacher who had me all four years of my high school career.  She's taken an interest in my photography as well.  Whenever I bring in photos or my portfolio or something to school she always expresses interest, and she asked me if I would take photos for the Latin club dinner.  I remember one day, I forgot my book, and I was scared to ask her if I could borrow a book because I know she hates it when girls don't bring their books to class, but I did ask her and she said, 'Well Rachel, since you're so sweet, I suppose you can borrow one.'  She has also made me fall in love with the Latin languange, and Roman culture, and I will always be indebted to her for that.  Thank God for all my wonderful teachers, and for today, especially Ms. Hernon.    "

It's not as tasty as the version I know (Amaretto shot in a 50/50 beer/Coke mix) but not bad.

883178,male,Fashion,"           Today I've been mulling over important decisions... like  urlLink Prince William or Prince Harry ?  The eternal question - the good boy, or the bad one?  According to  The Sun , Britain's  premier  tabloid,  'If Harry were in a movie hed be the baddie all the girls fancied who turns out to have a big heart after all. Think Top Guns Iceman.'   Somehow, I don't buy it.  But if it's selling papers, more power to them.         "
883178,male,Fashion,"           I think I have a lot of complexities, but I dont think that there are two types of people in this world.  Therefore, none of us are either/or.  If you need to label me, Im complex.  But heres my rundown on Dufs list:  1.  I am low maintenance.  For those of you that scoff at this, go on a camping trip (or another comparable activity) with me and then tell me your answer.  2.  I am not a genius.  3.  I dont need a lot for fulfillment.  I have no 5 year (or 1 year, or 25 year) plan.  If you asked me what my goals are in life, I would struggle to answer - not because I dont know what I want, but just because I really dont want much.  I cannot recall any time in my life where I have felt 'unfulfilled', 'empty', or anything of the like.  4.  Im left brain (though not extreme left brain).  5.  I rarely if ever see more in words/actions then speaker intends.  In English class when they would say that the red scarf represented life or hunger, I never saw that.  I wouldnt even remember the red scarf.  Same thing about foreshadowing, I was like, huh?  Its the same reaction I would have after watching Dawsons Creek and someone would say, I think Joey and Pacey are going to get together because of what he said at the hot dog stand, and I would be say oh yeah, I really liked the shoes that Joey was wearing in that scene!  6.  I highly enjoy subtlety and nuance (so heres is one of my complex features).  When the red scarf was discussed, I was always like, ahhhhh. thats pretty cool.  But then I would wonder if the poor author just happened to mention the color of the scarf with no motive, and now its being dissected in English classes for all eternity (again, making me complex).  When Joey and Pacey got together, I really liked seeing the repeats to see the (now obvious to me) hints that they were a far better couple than Joey and Dawson.  7.  I absolutely believe that all people are good (making me not complex).  But I also believe that everyone has good and bad in them (making me complex).  8.  I have idiosyncrasies and pet peeves.  But not more than the next gal.  9.  Ive had my nicks, but Im not high on the trauma scale.  That said, some of my complexities definitely arise from specific points (even moments) in my life, as do all of us.  10. I dont have a lot of passions, but those that I do have, Im very passionate about. (dunno if this makes me c or nc)  11. I accept people as they are.  I dont think that there is any right way to go about life.  I also believe very strongly that you cannot change another person (and thats a good thing).  12. I like to rotate between the island vacation and the city vacation, but I do lean towards the city vacation.  Something with historical significance is preferred.  Or involving a kick-ass concert.  13. There are no absolutes in life.  Except death and taxes, of course.          "

On Civilitas, it advertises for Iraqi Dinars (CAN SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME WHAT AN IRAQI DINAR IS??), although I'm pretty sure I haven't typed the word Iraq or Iraqi in there. Maybe it thinks...'Bush. What goes with Bush automatically? IRAQ!'  So let's just see about the journals I go to, hmm? All right.    urlLink  Ryan   , he protests against the movie because it sucks in comparison to the book, has an ad for 'I-Robot' movie wallpaper, etc. Plus an ad for the book. Which he already owns. So ppshaw. And   urlLink  Urza's    blog has ads for a 'simple depression cure' and 'gothic poetry.' I don't know if you're depressed or what, Urza, but it really doesn't seem like you are. And from what I understand, you are DEFINITELY not Gothic. Er.  One of my other blogger friends,   urlLink  Lor   , found a clever way to block the ads. I had one of those on my old journals, they rock but are hard to place. Too bad I don't get to find what she gets ads for :) foot fungus? Machine guns?

Might this have something to do with his second post, the Penguin Quiz he took? I guess they had to do that, or use an ad for urinals, as his first post calls blogs the urine of the internet. Like I told him last night, very vulgarly I might add, 'everyone must urinate :)'  Thanks again Grant for pointing the ads out...I'm selectively blind and tend to ignore a lot of detail. ^_^          "

3370336,female,indUnk,"       This morning I got into my car, dreading the horrendous drive up Highway 52 to work.  I sat in the car parked in my driveway long enough to let the engine warm up and get to that 'just right' temperature. At this point I was still trying to get a few more z's so I hadn't turned my music on yet.  Needless to say I eventually left my driveway and began my drive to work.  Just as I headed out of the top of my driveway I turned up the volume to my car stereo.  I beautiful piano was playing and then a soothing calming voice came over the piano.  It was Nicole Nordeman.  I had bought the Woven & Spun cd a few weeks ago and had not really listened to the entire cd except a few choice songs.  This morning it was on the last song of the cd.  'Graditude'! As I listened to the words of this beautifully written song, my heart began to hurt.  My eyes began to blur with enormous tears.  It was the line that says 'Oh, the differences that often are between Everything we want and what we really need,' pierced me.  I began to ask myself 'what is the difference?'  For me the difference is greatfulness.  I have been far too ungreatful for what I have, always looking at what I don't have, or the lack there of.  Not enough clothes, not enough jewelry, shoes, cds, makeup, money, furniture, dishes, and no boyfriend.  Its really the last one that God really spoke to me about.  All I 'need' is Jesus and yet I am focusing on 'wanting' a boyfriend.  How foolish to wish my life away instead of acting in servanthood.  I pray now that I can remember this personal revelation from God tomorrow-tonight-as I watch other couples...and remember that God is husband-he is my friend-he is my father-he is everything that no man could ever be.   Another quick excerpt: I kinda got a double whammy today.  My mom had slipped Glamour magazine into my car yesterday while I was helping her and her husband move some things around their house.  I have steered clear of these kinds of magazines for the last six months-just because they cause me to be dissatisfied.  Let's just say-curiosity got this cat-and I took the magazine into work today (which-by the way-was a day from hades) and read it inbetween phone calls.  I happened to come across this article entitled 'Love will find you' (or something to that extent) and it caught my eye.  I was able to read the whole three page article without getting one interruption.  God really blessed me with this because it was very encouraging.  It reminded me that my life isn't over after my twenties. I can still meet someone and fall in love and get married and have babies and have a crazy wonderful family life.  I almost cried at my desk at work-but I didn't-can't let everyone know how silly crazy I am. : )   I can see that God is really working something out of me and into me.  My ungreatfulness has certainly caused me some frown wrinkles-I'm ready for the happy ones.    I just pray now-that God will remind me of this continually.  I pray Jesus for peace to know that you are planning a perfect will for me-and that I can not fathom all that you have for me. Thanks Jesus for your love and patience with me.  Thank you for all that you have given me, from material posessions to friends and family-you are gracious in all your ways.  Love-Faith 05-17-04          "

So when Mr Lowe sends&nbsp;the 2nd Grade Table Tennis team&nbsp;to Ashfield to vs Epping, when instead we were suppose to go to Normanhurst to vs them, semi-final fever has no effect.

2844168,female,Marketing,"                 Today was another busy day. I always like Thursdays. My ladies Bible study always offers great encouragement and fellowship and today was no exception. It was weird to leave this morning and tell them I'd see them in a month. It's strange to think I'll be gone for almost 4 weeks. That's a long time!  Anyway, our Life Group was cancelled tonight which was a bummer. Our leaders are out of town and I guess everyone else was just busy or didn't want to come so they cancelled it. So it will be a really long time before I see everyone from there again.   We had a really loud thunderstorm come through tonight. It was kind of scary! It was so loud and shook our building. We think we must have been directly hit a few times. We lost power briefly like 3 times in a row. When it was over our internet wasn't working and we've boiled it down to two things - Ked's ethernet card and the router. They very well both might be fried. That's about par for the course right now. Ked's whole computer is on a crash course for the dumpster. The monitor is hissing and the computer crashes like every 10 minutes.

The author of MAODV use  bid++; rq->bid = bid;  while in original ns2, it uses rq->bid = bid++;  So there is a problem of duplicate bid. And the timout of bid is set to 6 seconds.

649790,female,indUnk,"              The Day When Many Things Happened  Let's start at the very beginning...a very good place to start...   12 pm   Woke up feeling really shitty, 'coz the night before I was all tense about my Italian Cinema take home exam question, which I had no idea how to write 'coz it had to center around 2 specific topics from a list. One topic, Migration, I could relate to the film (Looking for Alibrandi), but I had absolutely no clue which other to pick.  So I just read my Bible, and it seemed specifically tailored for me, talking about how we should rejoice in trials. To quote some movie I watched, 'That which doesn't break us only makes us stronger'. Was it Arnie? I don't remember.  So I decide to just pick one of the topics,  Mezzogiorno , and find out more about it, 'coz (a) it was part of the week's readings on Post War politics, which I could possibly link to Alibrandi and Migration, and (b) 'coz I wanted to know what it actually meant in English.  Typed in a search in askjeeves, and voila! It basically refers to the South Italy region, encompassing Sicily, Calabria etc. Woopee! Italian-Australian immigrants always harken back to their homeland, esp. Sicily, and it was done so in Alibrandi. Yay! Praise God.   1.30 pm  Mobile phone rang and I ran to pick it up. The caller ID said 'Anonymous', so it was from a private number. 'Hello? Is this Sarah?' 'Yes, it is.' 'Hi, I'm Mike from Gloria Jean's Coffees? I received your email early this morning. Could you come in sometime for an interview?'  In short, I'm meeting Mike, who's wearing a black shirt, tomorrow regarding a position as a barista/customer service staff at a new store they're opening on Bourke Street. Praise God for opportunities. I also applied for another job, a Call Centre one (answering questions on an upcoming govt. campaign), but they haven't got back to me.   3.15 pm  Am still on the bleeding tram when I should be in class already. I'm giving a presentation for my Italian Cinema class!   3.25 pm  Phew, class hasn't started yet. Prayer really works.   3.55 pm  Presentation went ok. Everyone was anxious to go to the pub (rest of tute lesson @ pub.  Cool huh?) so they weren't really listening. What to do, it's the last tute for the semester. Anyways, didn't join them - on to the next presentation, for TV Cultures.   4.00 pm  Well the Multimedia festival went well, though it ended late. Everyone's presentation was really good! Sadly, ours didn't win a prize (4 prizes for 7 groups, plus door prize draws). My 'honourable mentions' go to the group that talked about Phua Chu Kang and syntax, and also the guy that did celeb impersonations of Ozzy Osbourne and Bill Cosby talking about global television. V. funny.   8.00 pm  Doors open for the John Mayer concert! YAYYYYY!!   8.30 pm  Charlton Hill, an Aussie group sporting a cute front man perform. Really rocked the crowd. Not bad tunes - esp. the radio single, 'Two's Company' (at least that's what I think the title is).   9.45 pm   JM comes on stage!!! YAY!!!!  It was a fantastic concert, and the crowd was good, rocking and rolling along. I must say a lot for his musicianship - he's pretty good at the guit., and his voice is great too. He's fabulous to see 'live' too  - interacted with the crowd and all. Overall, nice prep/rock look - he was wearing a shirt, which was drenched by the end of the night.  Hehe, we sneaked in an MD player and recorded the entire thing! Although I talked at a couple of instances. And sang along too. Eep. Hopefully my voice doesn't come out, so the recording doesn't turn into  'John Mayer in Melbourne - the Karaoke Version'.  Charles read on his website that JM's actually fine with pple recording his performances, esp. since it's a good form of promotion. As long as $$ doesn't change hands. It's fine to let your friends have a copy and all. Now that, I think, is the right attitude to have. With all the hoo-haa over piracy and music and downloading MP3s and all, sometimes it's nice to have an artiste not being so  ngim-jim  over money. I mean, the record companies are having hernias over the whole piracy issue, mostly 'coz of the money they say they're losing. Get with the program - not making AS MUCH as you thought you would does NOT qualify as a loss. Most times they don't just break even, they have lotsa profits. Hello, Metallica?  Well, spending those few hours bouncing up and down was really fun, esp. since I got to share it with my 2 best friends in Melbourne, EG and Charles. We were standing in front of the speakers (oh my poor ears, I should have brought my ear plugs. They're still ringing now, more on the left ear though), @ the left side facing the stage. Irritated EG a lil' though, 'coz he was the designated photog. (he being tall and all), and I kept bugging him to take more photos. 'How many shots of him singing do you want? One with every light change issit?' 'No lah! But if can change angle also good lor. Maybe I should go the other side to take?' 'Tell you what lah. I'll scan the photo and then flip it around for you ok?'  Hehe.  Highlight of the concert? I went home with a souvenir - a signature guitar pick that one of his roadies threw in my direction after the concert. Yippeee!  Next up, Emily of Emerald Hill on Thursday. And possibly Bic Runga next month. (I'm still lamenting the Jamiroquai concert though. Really wanted to get tix early on, but no one to go with! Finally found out Johanna's going, but she's got tix already, and they're seated ones, not general admission  - apparently the GA ones are sold out. BOOHOOOOOO).   11.50 pm  Walked out of HiFi Bar.   2.26 am  Just finished this Blog entry. Going to sleep now. Nitey nite, I've an interview in the morning.  29 October 2002            "
4088616,female,Arts,"             File under: Too Weird to be True.  I dated a guy a few years ago. We were friends before and after we hooked up/broke up. This, in itself, is a miracle since, as most of us have discovered, break-ups mean never having to say ANYTHING ever again, let alone, 'Sorry.' The fact that we did remain good friends was very cool. We both dated other people and for awhile everything was fine. I was even helpful when his relationship came to a sad close. I was his ear, his confident, his buddy. I made up cool images for him to use on his new personal ad (when he was ready to start looking again). I even consulted with him on who might be a good choice to persue.  Then, 'she' came along. She found him. Not only did she find him, even though she didn't 'fit' his request of what he was looking for, he fell for her big-time. She is smart, funny, independent, a good mom. He said 'no one more than a few miles away from where I live.' She lives 65 miles away. 'No one with kids.' Oops...she has one. Doesn't matter. He's hooked. I expect wedding bells already and it's only been 3 months. He pretty much stopped talking to me about personal things. Yeah, he was busy with work ,but I was there for the bad times and now...well I just started to feel poverty stricken and lonely. Where was my buddy? He seemed to be gone.  I became obsessed with reading their blogs. I checked them almost every day. Each time I searched for clues. Did he love her more than me? Was she better than me? Were they having more fun than when we dated? I got to see pictures of them-a small peek through the door of their life together. I would see comments about cool furniture that my ex had in his apt...but did he ever tell anyone I picked it all out? She should probably love me just as much as him, since I had helped, behind the scenes, get him to do nice things for her (in the beginning before he closed off to me).  Then I went away on a Buddhist retreat for two weeks.  Part of what I learned while away was to focus on 'being' with irritation and be willing to just feel uncomfortable. The other part was to work on being open, instead of closed-off, closed-minded. I realized that the loss I felt was certainly natural since all things are in a constant state of change and change can feel painful. I also realized that instead of focusing on what I no longer had, I should take a better look around at my own life. I saw my relationship with a great man, who I have become tremendously intimate with. I finally feel comfortable around someone else. We have a radiance together. The problem was simply just learning to accept change, be open to what comes of it and stop being afraid...  ...and there she is. I am online. I am talking to my ex. He says; 'Would you like to meet K.?' Before I can answer...there we are, chatting away. I just went with it and I found things that really should not have surprised me. I think it was relief, actually. It was freedom. Whatever I was worried about fell away.   She is just as smart and capable and funny as I had guessed. I like her a lot. I think we will become great friends. I feel that already. I could have shut down and pushed this entire situation away. Instead, I not only get to maintain a very long friendship with my ex, but I get to be a small part of his life with K.   I sincerely feel a sense of amazement about this...and the extra shocker is she just offered up a project for me to work on. No, don't think she's being catty. Not. See, that's what comes of not clinging to the outcome, not being afraid. Once you let go of all that neurotic shit there's freedom.  [By the way, I do have to mention that K. also has extremely huge 'nuts' for being willing to chat with me, too. Yet another reason to be impressed with her. She is definitely a cool chick.]         "

Apparently someone pulled the door frame out of the wall (just an inch or so) and the elevator got stuck between floors.

It all started innocently enough. I went down to the cafe, dropped off the CV, spoke to the manager in English, he in his Chinese-accented English too.  The following week, I got a missed call from them, so I called back. The guy I spoke to (who wasn't the manager though), started speaking to me in Mandarin, so that's how it all started. I went down the next day with my timetable, and spoke to the manager in Mandarin, thinking, after all, hey I handled a whole conversation yesterday in the language, I can do this too. The manager seemed a little surprised at my speaking Mandarin though. Whatever it was, I was really proud of the fact I asked for his name before I left in the polite Mandarin form:    Oh, dui bu qi, qing wen ning gui xing?   (Oh excuse me, by the way, may I know your name?)  To which he replied: Oh,   Jah-mes    Teeheeheee...yeppers,  Jahmes  teeheeeheee  He called later that week, woke me up on a Friday morning, asking me (in Mandarin of course) if I could start work the following week. YES!! I was really happy - Praise God! Thing is, that early in the morning, ( 11  a.m. mind you - I mean who wakes up at   such  an ungodly hour?), I couldn't form the proper words to reply in Mandarin. So you can imagine how the conversation went:    Qing wen ze shi Huang xiao jie shi ma?   (Pardon me is this Miss Wong?)    Ahh..shi shi!   (Yes, yes!)    Wo shi chong XXX cafe da lai de.   (I'm calling from XXX cafe.)    Oh dui dui dui!   (Oh yes yes yes!)    Oh dui dui dui.  (Was he making fun of me??)  Qing wen ni zhao dao gong zuo le ma?   (Oh yes yes yes. May I ask if you've found a job yet?)    Oh hai mei you.   (Oh not yet.)  Blah blah blah...I was really struggling with it. He was asking me if I could shift my subjects around so I could work on Tuedays and Wednesdays. I just simply couldn't articulate properly what I wanted to say, and had to repeat myself a couple of times, peppering my broken Mandarin with a smattering of English words, like Timetable etc. Ughhh.  Finally, after everything was settled, I was about to say bye when he said,     Ni de hua yu jiang de bu tai hao hor?   (Your Mandarin really isn't very good is it? -> said as more of a statement than a question)   I was stunned to say the least. So I just said the only thing that popped into my head.    Hah??   (Hah??)    Wo shuo ni de hua yu jiang de bu tai hao hor?   (I said your Mandarin isn't very good is it?)    Oh dui, er, nah shi ying wei, er, Ying Wen shi wo di yi ge, er, language.   (Oh yes, er, that is because, er, English is my first, er, language.)    Nah ni jiu jiang Ying Wen ba.   (You can speak in English then.)    Oh hao, hao.    (Oh, yes yes -> I mean I really didn't know what to say. It just threw me! Sigh - Shanghainese are famous for their bluntness)    Xia ge xing qi jian.   (I'll see you next week then.)    Ah, dui.   (Ah, yes.)  E-Gene, who overheard the conversation, put it very succintly: 'Man, your Chinese really sucks!'  Sigh.           "

 &nbsp;  Crushes suck.&nbsp; When theres a crush situation, usually one person has the upper handnamely the object of the crush, who most likely doesnt have reciprocal feelings.&nbsp; Im always the one with the crush; Ive always felt like this is a handicap, even though Im not one to wear my heart on my sleeve.  &nbsp;  I hope I dont ever speak to, hear from or run into my old USSC.&nbsp; I cant even stand to hear/say his name nowadaysit makes me sad and a bit hurt (angry/bitter).&nbsp; Id much rather hate him now than remember how full of stupidity and hope I was, when I thought I was in (unrequited) love with him or that there was a slight chance he (at one time) might have been interested in me.&nbsp; Hell always be the one that got away, the unresolved unrequited crush, I suppose.  &nbsp;  I hate you, I hate you, I hate you.&nbsp; I hope you miss me.

3367100,male,Communications-Media,"                 Well, on one hand I am glad to see the Supreme Court tell this putz Michael Newdow to go home, but on the other I am disappointed they didn't make a stand and tell him to permanently go away, that 'One nation, under God'  does not violate the seperation of church and state.  I mean, George Washington himself said the blue in our flag represented Heaven.  And where does it say that a person that is an athiest HAS to say that part anyway?  I could come closer to understanding their argument if they were required by law to say it, but they are not.  They're not even required to say the pledge.  But instead, the Supreme Court said he couldn't sue to have that phrase removed on behalf of his daughter because he doesn't have custody of her.  While that is true, why did they take the easy way out and leave the door open for him or some other moron to bring it up again?  One of these days they'll have to rule on it on the basis of seperation of church and state, and I guess all we can do is hope they make the right ruling....             "
2635745,female,Student,"       This week is off to a good start.  A few set backs but great so far.  To start we did not have school on Monday and it snowed.  Yeah!  We went back to school Tuesday and I had fun presenting my Geography project to the class.  Imagine last year I was completely stagefright.  In second period we had a review game in Wellness, it was girls against guys.  There were seven girls left and one guy left and coach Waggoner asked the girls a question and they got it wrong and Kevin got it wrong now if the next girl go it right Kevin was out and the the girls got three extra points on their test.  But if she got it wrong Kevin was still in.  Now someone asked whose next and I timidly raised my hand.  And you hear guys say oh god she knows it.  And girls say yes.  I was like you don't know if I know it.  Then Coach Waggoner says now be quiet she knows it.  And then I answered and he said correct.  And because of me all the girls in our class got three points added to their test.  Later that afternoon we had practice and a meeting.  Now for the National Qualifying Events Competition our team was allotted two Public Forum Teams that did not count against our total allotment of entries.  Ms. Then comes into practice and said I want Lindsay and Sara on a team and on the other team I want Michael and Caitlin.  I'm thinking oh shit.  What the fuck am I going to do.  It will be really fun, but two whole days of Michael.  Nonstop Michael.  OH MY GOD!  But then I figured we'd make a good team.  I'm prepared he's not.  He has tons of knowledge.  I don't.  We're going to kick butt.  Whoo!   Ta Ta For Now         "
1708471,female,indUnk,"           I am so glad and so happy to say that 1st semester is over!!!!! That was the most hellish semester and like period of my life, wow. Seriously though I've never had to work that hard in my life and read so much and think so much. It's crazy what school does to you and how stressed out it makes you, seriously do we really need an education that much? I don't feel like I do. Oh well. So instead of college writing 2 and honors english, I now have outdoor photo and a study hall, that cuts my workload in half and wow am I going to be happy when I can actually finish all of my homework and read all my packets. I'm hoping for a little change in my grades..... ok more like a big change.   What pisses me off about this last semester and school is that I feel like I worked my ass off, but it doesn't show so much. Like yes I could have done more work and I could have stayed up until one every night to actually do all my homework and study for every class, but I can't do that, I fall asleep at like 11. But I still feel liek I put in a substantial amount of work, but it still wasn't good enough for me. My grades aren't too bad, but I still think they suck, oy I don't know. I just feel like everything that I work for and actually want to do good in and try to do good in, blows up in my face at the end. Like seriously this week I have never felt so much like a failure. I studied my ass off like since saturday and didn't do anything at all and then I take the tests and I feel like I failed them all, like seriously I'm sure I did. It's the worst feeling ever to feel like you have worked so hard to get to this one point and to accomplish so much and when the time actually comes it's like no you can't do good, you can't accomplish everything you want to. It's not only school though, hockey too. I'm probably making a bigger deal about it then it is, but it still pisses me off. I've been playing first line for like 5 weeks or more and then I got a concussion on saturday, played like shit that game anyways, and then found out I coudlnt' play in our game on tues. that sucked. Anywho, now someone else is playing first line and it's total bullshit 'cause I work my ass off ten times more then she does, and she even told me she doesn't want to play 1st line!! And then brandi and other people on the team are like kati I do'nt know why you're not playing 1st, you deserve it more than anyone. I don't know maybe things will change for the game this sat., I hope they do 'cause I have been working so hard to get to that spot and I finally did and then after being out for a day, one day, it's taken away from me like that, wow that sure feels good.....  I'm so sick of complaining though, yes I am stressed, yes I work my ass off and barely get a break, but I put myself in the position of working so hard, I can stop, but I don't, as simple as that. I just wish I can do good at something and stay good at something and actually fully accomplish something without it blowing up in my face at the end. Whatever.   So I think I'm going to Colorado for sno daze weekend, aka valentines weekend. I'll be going with my cousins so it'll be a lot of fun, but ya one problem..... I don't know how to ski or snowboard, haha oops. But ya I think it'll be so much fun and a good experience so I'm gonna go. But ya then there's the thought, well maybe I should stay here 'cause it is valentines day weekend and sno daze and something could happen.... but then what would happen? Valentines day has actually been pretty bad for my in the past, ok not bad, just not good. I have never once gotten one thing from a guy while all my friends have, it's kinda sad, but oh well. But hey maybe I'll meet someone in colorado! haha, yes I know, I'm dreaming. But seriously think how romantic that would be, I'm out there skiing, ok more like falling on my ass, and then I just randomly meet, or run into, this guy and then he ends up staying in the same place I am, and then we spend the rest of the weekend together, it's like a movie!! Ha, yes I know that'll never happen, but I like to think about it, it gives me more of a reason to go to colorado.   So my new, or more favorable, obsession is now underwear, oh and Orlando Bloom, but most people should know about that one, wow I love that guy.... but ya underwear. It's a really good but really bad obessesion for me to have. It's not like anyone is actually going to see my underwear, or at least the people who would actually care, guys, but I still go out and buy like $12 underwear from like Abercrombie or Victoria's Secret. On top of that I do'nt even have any money so I don't know how I'm getting away with that. But it is a fun obsession because they're really a lot of cute underwear out there and ya, it's fun to own, haha ya ok I'm done with that.   Even though I slep till 11:30 I'm still tierd.  The easiest way to get what you want it to help others get what they want. -Deepak  Chopra  : )~Kati         "

There is an old guy making out with a girl in that car' and pointed out the car behind us.  I looked over and caught a haggard-looking man who seemed to be around 70, smooching on a woman who was probably in her mid-twenties.  I'm glad I wasn't eating at the time.  I can only surmise that she was a prostitute, but the vehichle, woman, and location did not provide the context in which I would expect to stumble across someone turning a trick.  That said, I don't think those two were exactly dating.  As my companion pointed out 'oooohh, I think she's really drunk'.  Ewwww!  And you think Bob is a slut?         "

3907370,male,Sports-Recreation,"                At this years Olympics in Athens, the us will be represented by Maurice Greene.  In a world where people outside the US think of us as loud, rude and generally obnoxious, we will be represented by someone who typifies all of these attributes.  Mo Greene is the self proclaimed 'Greatest of all time,' and rarely will he pass up the opportunity to let you know this fact.  While Greene has run a sub 100m dash 47 times in his career, his attitude and celebrations are equally as astonishing.  In the last Olympics he was a ring leader of one of the most embarrassing post race displays in which the Men's 4x100 meter relay team celebrated their gold medal by draping them selves in the American Flag and posing in front of photographers in a variety of poses usually reserve for a body building contest.  Then several months ago at a tune up meet for the Olympic trials Greene had a teammate spray his shoes with a fire extinguisher after he won the finals of the 100m dash.  The Olympics are based on the premise of world camaraderie through sports.  This does not include showing up all over your opponents with the actions of a testosterone enhanced peacock.  Olympic athletes are supposed to be ambassadors of this great country and are supposed to represent everything that is good about the United States.  Instead this year at the Olympics we will be represented by someone who has repeatedly represented every stereo type the world has for us.    One more note regarding the Olympics.  Many athletes from NBA, and the Williams sisters declined invitations to participate sitting security concerns as the reason.  I find this very self centered, there are literally hundreds to thousands of athletes in this country who would love to have the privilege of competing for there country.  I wonder if these people realize that the last terrorist attack that took place at the Olympics was in Atlanta, and was carried out by an American.  Grow up Serena, you are not that important that the terrorist are going to single you out, and didn't the last attack on a tennis player in a public place happen at a respected tennis tournament.  You have the opportunity to lead our nation to gold, and you back out and site security, give me a break, you probably want more time to design clothes or hob-nob with celebs.   That's just one guy's opinion!         "

1708471,female,indUnk,"           Ok Saturday..... First off I woke up at 10:30 which is hella early for me thanks to my buddy Kate for turning on the lights! But it's ok we had to get up.... we  had a big day in front of us..... we took an adventure to the one the only Minnesota State Fair!!!!!! High quality I tell ya. But ya me Kate, Chelsea, and I went to the fair, it was lots of fun except the part where I started to get blisters on my feet from my flip flops, bad idea, and when I got into a little fight against a certain someone who's name starts with a K and ends in a ate. Ok so if someone calls you selfish but you say that you aren't they are, does that make you even more selfish? I don't know if that makes sense.... It's late..... Anywho the highlight was when we went to the Kare 11 station for 2 hours and didn't even get on tv, we were in the stands and everything...... but hey we did get free food from them it was tight! We got a foot long hot dog, shaved ice, cookies, rice krispie bars, and this burrito thing.... yummmmm....... but what makes it the best was that it was free!! We also bought cheese curds, of course you can't go to the fair and not get any, and carmel apples in a dish with ice cream.  We also saw a lot of people at the fair, the first person was Mr. JT!!! Ok ya sorry, using initials today. Yeah, that was exciting, it really highlighted the whole state fair experience. 2nd person or people, was when we were looking for Emir's carmel apple stand when we realized it wasn't his, but PS's! JB also works there, but we didn't talk to him, ha fred, but ya we talked to PS and visited him a couple more times after, that was exciting, he's a good kid. And then later we finally found Emir or sorry EB and DJ where I guess JB works also. So ya we talked to EB and DJ for a while too, it was fun. Oh people a good.  So yes the state fair was fun and interesting and we got lots of free stuff and saw lots of ducks and bunnys and cows and sheep and pigs, aww pigs So later tonight we got together with the peoples again, and we ended up going to the lake again. Ok first off when we got there I had this odd feeling about it all and it was really scary there 'cause it was really windy and ya just didn't seem right, so from the beginning I was freaking out. But anways we walked down the path to the beach and then we were standing by this bench and all of a sudden we just see this man, just one, sitting there like on the rocks in the water and he wasn't really moving, so Nick and I, everyone else was stupid and stayed, took off running, and got freaked out, but then we turned around, but ya it was really freaky and weird 'cause you just don't go to a beach at dark with no lights by yourself, but ya we kinda stayed a little longer, with me of course freaking out, and he was just sitting there, yes he moved up and was alive, and kinda was just watching us, I freaked out and left, haha. But ya that was some odd shit. Oh ya and Kate like gave me a raper today.... there was this guy who was walking down my street and Kate goes that's odd and then when he was passing my window Kate yells out Hello! And he doesn't say hello or keep going he stops and goes up to my window!!!! And then he's like ya I'm here to humiliate myself and Kate says tell me your speech.... I dunno.... but ya he actually didn't do anything he just kinda stood outside my house for like 5 min, and we're like ok no go away now, and ya it was really freaky and now he knows where I live! But ya it was an weird ass night.  Ok who believes in fate and signs with like guys and love and all that shit? Enlighten me with your thoughts on that please....... ChickaSS31@aol.com ....... but ya I need a homecoming date.... I also have to wake up at like 7:30 so I'm going to bed! KO         "

883178,male,Fashion,"           Duf,  As you requested, I have written my one letter.  I wrote this to Kellogg's, praising their Special K Red Berries cereal.   Dear Sir/Madam:  You dont know how happy it makes me to see those freeze-dried strawberries every time I pour myself a bowl of Kelloggs Special K Red Berries.  I have always been a big fan of the traditional Special K  growing up, my grandma ate a bowl everyday while preaching your mantra to anyone who would listen: if you can pinch an inch  So with the addition of the Red Berries, not only am I keeping grandmas legacy alive, but Im also enjoying the sweetness the new Berries have to offer.  However, I do have 2 questions:  1) Why did you name the strawberries Red Berries?  Is there a trademark on the word Strawberry?  Do people ever complain because they were expecting RASPBERRIES in their cereal? (because those are red too) 2) Have you ever thought about selling the freeze-dried strawberries SEPARATE from the cereal?  I have to say, sometimes I just empty a box and dig around for the crunchy sweet goodness of the Red Berries.  They remind me of when I tried space food when I went to the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago as a kidweird texture, but oddly delicious.  You could dominate an entirely new food category with this idea: Cereal Accompaniments.  If you sell them separately in their own bags, consumers could buy them to put on any kind of cereal they wish, not just Special K.  Please tell me if this is something you have already considered.  And again, thank you for a great breakfast experience.  Keep the Berries coming.   I will keep you posted on any reply I receive. I am already expecting a form letter, so maybe I'll be delightfully surprised.         "

Shit I'm thinking of him throughout the day.  Talking about him constantly.  It seems to come from out of no where.  Natay this, Natay that.  I know people get tired of it.  I do too.  It only makes my fall harder and stay deeper in the feelings I cannot seem to control.  I just want to be with him forever.  It sucks, because when it doesn't happen I am going to be sooooo hurt.  Man, I can almost feel it just thinking about it.  Why can't I just have him.  I don't know if I can't, but I don't know if I can either.  This not knowing sure sucks.  I don't like it.  What did he do to make me fall for him so.  He is just wonderful.  He's beautiful.  He has a beautiful person.  He's so true and so honest.  How many guys out there are this good.  There probably are  a lot, but how much rubbish do you have to crawl through to find them.  Too much.  I just want to keep him.  It makes me feel so dreamy and so longing and the same time thinking about it.  I think I'd be so happy if I could be with him forever.  We have so much fun together.  Laughing, talking playing, smiling.  We just genuinely have a great time in each other's company.  Love, it is something funny isn't it.  The emotions it takes you through.  But it can feel so good.  Just being in love.  Man I want to see him right now.  I can wait until I see him this weekend.  I'm like a kid getting ready to go to Disney land for the first time.

3649763,female,Banking,"                 that's what I would truly like to beeeeeee. Cause if I were an Oscar Mayer wienerrrrrrrr....everybody'd be in love with me.   I treated myself today to some dresses, I felt so gross the last week. I realized I had only one really 'pretty' dress..I am a girl I guess I can act like one once in a while instead of feeling like I have to be some plain non descript blending into the crowd figure. I'd like to be able to look in the mirror and say 'Daaaamn I look GOOD!' and really think it. For all my bravado about not caring what other people think about my looks...I need to be less critical about what I think of them. I know the really good stuff is on the inside, I know how to love, I know how to care, I know how to make others feel appreciated...But I live in a culture that has ingrained into my being this myth about beauty. I did some reading a few nights about about body image and older civilizations...dammit if I lived in the time of Reuben...I'd be a SuperModel...lol. We are taught young to find fault with ourselves...our lack of looking like that less than 1% of women who actually do model. I still find it so bizarre they use women we can never be instead of the women we are to sell us things. There would be something self satisfying to see more women just like us model...or models chosen on the basis of their deeds...cause in the end it's how good you WERE not how good you LOOKED.   &nbsp;  I had more to say but I got distracted, so yeah then I guess I am done for now.

3389671,male,indUnk,"       I'm at work eating lunch right now. A turkey scamich and a 'Courage' Sobe, those commies don't have Green Tea in the machine.   I have been thinking about writing another game but don't know what to write. I thought about doing a combat clone (like the old atari 2600 combat tank game) but that is a little too basic. A big problems I have with making games is my lark of a real artist. I gave up on my Rolling Thunder(tm) style game because it was really hard to stay excited about a bunch of odd chapes moving around on the screen.  I want to make an adverture type game with swords and stuff, but that's probably because I've had Zelda on the brain recently. I wonder if the Zelda games are named specifically after Zelda Fitzgerald...I guess I'll never know.  I like top down shooters, maybe I'll make another one of those. Earth Defender B was kinda lame, though it still ranks as my only game with sound effects.   For the people reading what kind of 2D game would you like to see, maybe a puzzle game? I don't know.         "
4192173,male,Technology,"             After more months of drum sessions in Garden City than I care to remember, the Factor Corp. - sans Robin, who was deservedly cavorting with her boyfriend - met at Birdcage for a meeting/listening session covering the drum recordings and edits thus far. We had not been in a room together for some time, and it was good to see everyone and catch up on life.  Reaction was largely upbeat, especially to 'Our Faith,' 'Exist' and 'Leningrad.' 'Our Faith' has the most work complete thus far, as it was the first edit I tackled using Ableton's Live, a stellar program for time correction. At best, however, the process is tedious. I  could  complete a song per day... if I were putting in a 12-hour day of editing. But real life shit means that I'm getting through a song about every three to four days, thereby making most of April editing time. Ugh.  The one point of contention came up during 'Theme From Propaganda,' Ash's Russian club monster with live bass and guitars. Robin played a staggered drum pattern over the 4/4 programming that I love, even in its unedited form, but that Ash and F hate on the basis that it makes the song too busy. I am standing by my opinion of the drums... for now. But the song is Ash's baby, so once I finish my edits this week, I will hand over the drum parts to him and let him make the final call.  Yesterday the band also had the opportunity to meet Kathie, my long-time photographer friend who will be shooting the Factor photos for the CD art and Web site. Kathie sat in on about half of the session, listening to us bicker and lending me cigarettes. And she was quite charmed by F and Ash, who have rubbed off on me, apparrently. I am not certain what this means, and Kathie did not care to elaborate, but I will assume this is a good thing.  Random aside: About half of the new Skinny Puppy album is amazing. Absolutely fucking amazing. Industrial may not be dead after all, if only the kids will rally to support this.  The evening before I caught the hipster gig of the year, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club and The Rapture in a double headlining stop at Roseland Ballroom. It was my first time seeing both bands, as I made the massive error of missing BRMC during their stops at Warsaw and Irving Plaza in 2003. The good: BRMC were stellar, and The Rapture sounded far more tuneful and coherent live than they do on their 'breakthrough' LP,  Echoes , revered by every white twentysomething in Brooklyn with an afro. The bad: The audience, which was exactly what you would expect at this gig. The worse: The vibe of both bands' best performances was ruined by the crowd's indifferent, muted response to everything. Shouldn't blistering performances of 'Stop' and 'Love Burns' warrant a bit more enthusiasm? I would think so.  The unexpcted: The audience popped the hardest for 'Olio,' 'I Need Your Love' and a few other Rapture tunes with only electronics and drum machines. Strange, given the hipster crowd's fondness for sloppy guitars. And the ridiculous: The Rapture's Gabe Andruzzi, whose onstage antics proved that, unlike Blue Oyster Cult, his band does  not  need more cowbell.  Speaking of up-and-coming bands playing obnoxiously large and overhyped shows, seeing BRMC and The Rapture reminded me of why I  didn't  bother to see the Yeah Yeah Yeahs at Hammerstein Ballroom earlier in the year. As much as I adore this band, I cannot imagine their energy translating well in any venue larger than Irving Plaza. And at the risk of sounding like the elitists who selfishly want success to elude small bands, the point of all this is lost on me when gigs become hipster clusterfucks. A friend of mine put it best the other evening: 'Damn, we were lucky to see them when we did.'         "

3468570,male,Student,"       Comin' to think of the above date of entry, I was wondering about this entry 'In the Year of Our Lord One Thousand Four Hundred and Ninety-two'. It seems so long ago when you read about such diary entries too. Anyway, that date was the year when Christopher Columbus left Seville port in Spain for the Carribean which he deemed it to be Asia intially.   What was I supposed to say anyway? Oh yes, I had been very bad at speaking other languages actually. Like for example, you are not supposed to call Octobre as 'Oct-to-breh' but simply call it as it was pronounced in English. And the word depot is not supposed to be called 'de-port', but simply as 'dere-poh'. Believe it or not, it is true. (Too much French influence infused into le Language I guess.) And 'le' is used as an emphasis in American English, with courtesy of UrbanDictionary of course! So this is le diary de le me le et cetera. But it's not uncommon 'cause I've been using it for ages to irritate many friends so that they will say 'ENOUGH OF DIE FRENCH CULTURZ'! Yap..it's made to sound German with all the crazy Zs at the back of le some words.  Never mind...it's so lame. And I guess no one will ever understand my jokes unless the person is usually English-educated and has a wide knowledge of Hollywood gossip. (Mmmmm!) Paris Hilton is also stupid too, with her blond hair, and her smarter companion of Nicole Ritchie. [She smears the name of Lionel Ritchie, and Paris smears the great Hilton empire with The Simple Life.] And I can't really accept that Kathy Hilton is gonna' make a new drama called The Good Life but it's kinda' nice to watch 'cause rich upperclass ladies can be seen bitching each other around too.  In Deo Nos Credamus! The original motto of the United States in Latin. But look at the country, are they really trusting God these days? Are they fearing God these days? And for those who suck at Latin, the Latin motto means 'In God We Trust'. And for those Latin experts, I use 'nos' to emphasize le motto. If not it will be known as In Deo Credamus, which is definitely not emphasized at all! Lingua Latina lingua bonam est! Go find out for yourself if you have no crazy idea what the above sentence Latin means!   Okay, cannon saliva I am! How about rest some? Now, goodbye!         "
3835942,male,indUnk,"           Last weekend was a memorable one for me!  I have been to the street at George V near Arc De Triomphe to buy a camera looking for a SONY showroom. It’s verisimilar to the Brigade Road in Bangalore but its very long and very wide with wide platforms.  When I reached here I was thinking that people here are too cold like the weather here. But the walk down that street made me re-think! People are screaming! But maybe that’s not real happiness, but at least you get a feel of how it would look like!  On both the sides of the street there are big automobile showrooms of every international carmakers!  Wherever you go you see the orderliness of the buildings and the meticulous plan of the city that makes transport so easy and trouble-free unlike our Indian roadways and railways which are quite confusing! You just have a map of Paris with the routes of RERs, Metros and SNCFs (various types of trains) and voila! you can go anywhere without troubling anybody. Cool!  Then at last in a showroom in La Defense I saw a camera that was good and I bought it.  The next day I’ve been to 'Musee de Louvre' and 'Tour Eiffel'.  Just to behold the building of the museum, which they say was used by Napoleon Bonaparte, is wonderful. It’s too huge.  The museum is divided into 4 main buildings with 2 stages. After spending some 6 hours inside, I could cover only half of it!  The sculptures and the paintings have a lasting influence, which makes them eternal. The Greek and Italian sculptures of the well-built kings and soldiers made me feel very puny! There is one feeling that runs and that connects all these pieces in the museum together. BEAUTY. Exquisite, exemplary beauty in all its splendours. No inhibitions whatsoever. The artists just seem to express themselves.  The sculptures and paintings make you think that artists love nudity for its revealing beauty of the human body. Felt proud of having one of those myself! Common people seem to abuse this!  When I saw those paintings, I really wondered how the society would have tortured those artists, those amazing gods of eternality, for they might not have been 'productive' by its standards! Surely many of them would have died of starvation for the world accepts a genius only after it slays him! Felt really strange! Every one of those paintings and sculptures tell you a story , even though the explanation given by the placards placed in front of them speaks French! I understand and cry as a salute to those gods!  There was a rush to see the Monalisa painting .For once, you feel that all ways in the museum lead to that painting! But when I saw that, I couldn’t quite understand what’s so great about it, thanks to my appalling ignorance of art! That too the lady looks as if she has not slept properly posing for the picture! In spite of my ignorance, I saw many other paintings that captured my attention and ate my memory card of the camera!  Next I've been to the Eiffel tower, just to have a look at it. Thought that it would not be so interesting and would be dull to behold. But as usual I was proved grossly wrong! What a massive structure and what imagination! Indeed people who love beauty seem not to think of logic, reasoning and purpose. But I think that even though it looks like that prima facie, its not so. Beauty is in itself a purpose! Create things which are beautiful and you have given them a meaning for them to exist!  When I get closer and closer to the tower, I slowly realized the size. I felt really fearful when I was at its foot. Beauty and mass mixes up to produce fear?! Quite strange! For every 10 minutes of an hour they switch on the lights, which randomly sparkle all over the tower and which simply cannot be captured by a still camera! Nor do I think that any kind of recording can capture the feeling. I stopped clicking and just stood at the foot and looked up and it’s a dream! Forget everything and look at it! You feel at once lost and above anything else!  People here seem to pay a lot of attention to beauty, love and experience.   THEY LIVE!  Merci.          "

3912317,female,indUnk,"        Hello lovely people......    How are you all on this perfectly desolate but glorious morning/afternoon/evening?    I cut myself, so now i'm trying to stop my hand from bleeding so err...profusely. When blood mixes with water it looks like Kool-Aid....haha, movie blood! Hmm...yeah, blood is interesting to study. No, not just because of my semi-obsession with vampires (b00!), and no not because my favorite color is red. *evil smile*     Well, since i woke up about an hour ago, there haven't been sufficient 'events' to write an entry about my day so far.    This summer has been really strange. It rains for days at a time, then we get one sunny day, and then it's cold for days after that. This is something i wrote about the seasons. Each stanza is a different season (not that hard to figure out). Stanzas 2 and 4 are only written using words to express what you smell or hear. Have fun.....i'll write more later on.          "
3358564,female,Education,"   'Witchcraft,' I don't know why I've developed this strange pre-occupation with Frank Sinatra.  I never listened to him while he was alive. But the day he died, I walked into the local coffee dive and suddenly, I discovered him. It was a tribute, and I was getting a posthumous revelation. H-- & V think I'm a little crazy!  But really, he's quite deep!   My whole life seems like that; I'm always catching things after the fact. I missed meeting the beautiful and great DWM's, Shakespeare and Milton. I missed the French revolution; I missed the roaring twenties. I even missed Che Guevara, and the sixties! I missed the sixties by being born. Hah!   I suppose I am a little nutty.  Nonetheless, My grades are done!  I was having anxiety dreams over all of those papers; I graded every last one. Now, I am feeling like I'm experiencing some sort of recoil, still slightly swirling, I don't know what to do with myself.       J spoke with me a lot this week.  I'm might have gone out with him, but I had been too distracted.  What I mean is-- that I don't think it is too healthy turning to J as I'm reeling from K.  So maybe this coming week, if the weather of my heart is a little more clear, dissipated, I'll go out with him.  I do like J, and I want to be fair to him.  I just don't want to look at him and think, 'How come K isn't like you?'   But J has his own charisma. He let me know a bit about himself.  Both of his parents are teachers. He lived in Europe for several years, and he loves the French!  You know what else?  He's so, so, nice!  That right there made me drop my papers right in front of him, and start stumbling over my words... Ah yes, intelligent young woman suddenly turns stupid syndrome returns!    And that's just it; I never have had to play stupid around a guy, and I would never,  ever , lower myself!  When my smart girl friends play stupid to catch an idiot, it really irritates me. How demeaning! If the guy can't like you for your brain, then it is all a lie!  But when I am really  REALLY,  attracted to a guy, I do suddenly go brain dead!  It takes me a time to gather my wits about me...  In my mind, I'm still stuck on, 'Oh my God, he's so cute, and so funny, and he's just so, so, so...'  Usually, I can tell if I'm moved by the guy in view just by my tone, my humor, and if I've dropped something!    Oh, I'll have to share some of the more momentous instances where I've dropped or spilled something in front of a possible lover. Sometimes, I am such a dork! I wonder would what Freud would think of my infatuation symptoms...   On Tuesday, I carefully pulled my grade reports out of my box.  I held them firmly in my hand.  I went through my box pulling other things, books and what not.  I was in the office area not really focused on anything.  Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a shadow of a figure pass by the door. J! He stuck his head in, and then rushed in the room.  I looked at his beautiful blue eyes, and I suddenly felt so self conscious.  I kept fidgeting with my shirt and running my fingers through my hair.  And of course, I couldn't help, but smile and laugh! I'm not sure what we were talking about in those first few minutes.  I just remember him saying something about 'Santa Cruz.' I was thinking of that old Police song, 'Do, Do, Do, Da, Da, Da, is all I want to say to you,' just fuzz. Then to snap myself back, I said, 'Of course, near John Steinbeck country...' I told him I grew up 'behind the orange curtain' in Southern California.  At that moment, I thought I was really being my witty self again, but when I moved to the center of the room, my eyes grazed the floor.  The grade reports had landed so nicely, spread out like we were going to do a ground view. He picked up all the papers.  Didn't even say word.  As to how I loosened my grip? I don't know. Certainly, I had been intent on being smart and non-angular. I thought I had it together!!!    In the meantime, the secretary kept distracting him.  Apparently, she wasn't too pleased with our conversation. Jim rolled his eyes a bit. I looked at the time, and knew I had to go.  But J whispered, 'Come with me to my office...'  So there I went!  Too cute!  I kept looking at him, and he kept looking at me.  He asked my age indirectly.  I told him, 'I'm going to be depressed when I turn 35; maybe, I'll get drunk.'  He hesitated for a moment and said in a soft sweet tone, 'When I turned 35, I was in love!'  I felt that one;  I really felt that one!  Trying to disguise my warmth, my red face, I smiled and said, 'Well, that's always so nice to be in love...'  He then gave a qualifier, 'It's over now...'  He told me that he is 37!  Ah! Perfect!  Too cute!    I went on my way after he told me a bit more about his life,  that he managed a bar in a small town in the North West. I don't know why it is so important for him to tell me his story.  Ok, so now I'm really being dumb!  He likes me too. Good! Very good!   Ok, one more instance...  I had to call him the next day to ask about a grading issue. Again, We had a very nice conversation.  He said, 'Are you Italian?'  I said, 'I'm pretty much French...'  'Then,' he explained in that sweet, soft tone, 'Don't feel guilty for giving that student an F; The French have no conscience, remember?'  I had to laugh!  The guy makes me laugh too!  He went on to tell me that he knows a bunch of bad words in French.  I didn't bother volunteering my French potty mouth; I mean, when you grow up with a French father, you get accustomed to hearing 'Putaine' this and 'Sallop' that.  Yet still, he then said something really, really, cute, 'Well, when we have a more personal moment together, I'll have tell you all the bad French words I know...'    Provocative indeed! So we ended it there. When I dropped off my grades on Wednesday, I didn't want to go by his office. I just thought I should give myself a bit of space; I want to be sure that I don't have any of K's prickles and stings left.   But I must say, I think I'm looking forward to this 'personal moment'...

883178,male,Fashion,"            Anita Gaye  By Duf Fer  Apparently there is a new show on television's Bravo network where five gay gentlemens will do a life makeover for a straight gentleman.  It's called 'Queer Eye for the Straight Guy.'  I think I need to be on this show.    First of all, I have been wearing essentially the same kinds of clothes since 1980 when I started to pick my own outfits. It is almost impossible to see me in something other than a polo style shirt and Docker's style pants (standard brown shoes by Vegetarian Shoes of London, thanks).  I bought new glasses and was horrified by what I perceived as a radical eyewear departure, but only one person at work has noticed (props to HAL).  In other words, my radical departure was not a departure at all.  Second, my eye for interior decorating is not only color blind, it is blind, blind.  So I could benefit from some fabulous direction as well.    Third, when I go to a restaurant, I usually eat the same thing.  In part this is because most places have 3 or 4 vegetarian choices, but it is also linked to my (mild) epicurean conservatism.  I know enough not to embarass myself at a business dinner, but I could also use some culinary refinements (ex:  we were at Savories in Stillwater last weekend, and when they brought out the figs with candied almonds and creamed gorgonzola as a pre-meal palate exciter, not only did I think it was tiny limes with whipped cream, but I didn't know if I should eat the entire fig or what...HELP!)  Last, the only time I have ever changed my hairstyle was in college.  I had a high top fade for a semester or two (and compared to Kid-n-Play it was more of a mid top fade), but other than that, I have sported to same doo since conception.    I went to the  urlLink show's web site , but to sign up for a makeover, you have to live in the New York area.  Drats!           "

3022585,female,Education,"        Restaurants are closing or are closed by now.  It’s late, but you’re hungry.  You’re not sure you want to cook, but you really want a salad.  Drive to Ukrop’s on your way home.  Rifle through your dashboard CDs looking for Emmylou Harris.  You need Emmylou’s mellow voice to match your mellow mood.  She’s not there, but you’re happy you find Johnathan Rice.  Put it in the CD slot.  The volume is louder than you expect but you don’t change it realizing “Quiet Hushed Voices” is what you were really craving.  Sing along to it with the sunroof open.  Don’t mind the people in the parking lot looking at you with bass flowing out the open windows.  Keep singing the words.  Park, knowing you are only pausing the moment.  Enter the automatic doors.  Pick up romaine lettuce and chevre.  A salmon fillet is a sudden passing desire; you grab it, and hummus, for snacking.  Check yourself out in the self-serve lane.  Get back in the car.  Turn the key and hit the sunroof button.  Keep the duet with Johnathan going.  Feel your brother’s bass in the floorboards and through the speakers in the door.  This is good music.  Know that you can’t go home.  You want to drive and listen and feel the wind.  There are no mountains here, no country roads just 5 minutes away.  There is the highway.  Head toward home, but pass it.  Make the right hand turn you make every morning on the way to work.  Bare left this time.  Take the toll road, the Downtown Expressway.  You need a hit from the city buildings; the skyline up close and 50¢ is worth it.  Pass Rosewood and the U of R Stadium.  Put Johnathan on repeat.  Slow at the toll booth until the SmartTag signals a green light to keep going.  Speed up, a horse out of the gate.  Get the center lane.  Pass VCU and the Cherry St. overpass.  Pass the 2nd St. exit and Thomas Jefferson’s Capitol building.  Go under a quarter mile of overpasses with lights burning a fluorescent tunnel.  Emerge to the buildings of downtown Richmond.  Wonder why so many lights are on.  Follow the signs to 95 North and 64 West, Washington and Charlottesville.  Curve around on the highway bridge through low buildings.  Look out the window, to the left, at the taller lit buildings.  {I want to love this city.}  Be amazed that you are driving so close to the bricks and concrete.  See the clock tower of the renovated Main St. train station on the right side, you can almost touch it.  Sing with Johnathan.  Get off at the Broad St. exit.  Go quickly through Shockoe Bottom.  Remember the recent attacks here.  Get back to 95 going South this time to Petersburg.  Stay in the right hand lane, curve right at exit 73C toward the Powhite.  Imagine you are not driving but are suspended, floating through these buildings, under the highway above you.  Look through the windows of La Difference.  Wish you understood the difference.  Go back through the tunnel of lights.  Pass the Jefferson Hotel and the Governor’s Mansion.  {I want to love this city’s history.}  Pass the exit for the Boulevard.  Quell the wish to live there in an apartment alongside Virginia’s museums and with a balcony.  Go on to Cary St.  Go to your home.  Park and walk to your building.  With the full moon behind say quietly and to no one 'I want to love this city.'  Unlock you door.  Put down your bags.  Wash you hands.  Decide it’s too late for salmon.  Get a large bowl out.  Pour the salad into it.  Begin to toast pecans from the freezer.  Crumble the chevre over the lettuce.  Pour on your homemade balsamic dressing.  Add the toasted pecans.  Take a bite as you walk to the living room, to your computer.  Realize you are a good cook, that this salad should be on menus.  Sit down at your laptop.  Put Johnathan on again.  Listen to him, and write this.         "

Can I look like them?  aka do I have the right hair without the annoyance of a wig?   2. If I have a great idea for the costume, like the Naruto sleeping hat.  Thats worth wearing a wig for. 3. Of course, if I WANT to.  I just HAD to have the bugs!!  THE BUGS!!!

Goes something like --> I looked in the mirror and scowled at the bags under my eyes, no amount of wearing my contacts will make them go away, I hate them!!

BUT, I could soooo do Hayate!  I even have the right hair just now, my eartails are just by my chin line now since I have switched to Hinata hair.  (Just cut it yesterday) woooo.  I am very happy with this idea.    Oh and what IS up with the coughing?  Is that guy sick?  I mean he's a medical nin, how can he be perma-sick? And the BIG question?   Should I wear the little triangle that's the Japanese way of depicting a dead person or not?  I think so.         "

2844168,female,Marketing,"                 Ked took the car to the dealership today and the prognosis was not good. It appears that the engine is burning oil. Ked added 2 quarts yesterday and it seems that the car was turning off due to lack of oil. The dealership advised us that the car needs a new engine which would cost about $7500. At this point putting a new engine in would cost more than the car is worth. This is frustrating beyond words especially since we only bought the car a year ago and it has less than 100,000 miles on it. But what can you do? We know that all we can do is control our attitudes and not let our testimony down. Ked had a non-Christian co-worker today comment on Ked’s positive outlook through all of this. Wouldn’t it be awesome if God would use something as frustrating as this as a chance for us to share the reason for our positive outlook? We know that cars are a temporary thing, and we seek to live in view of what matters most in eternity, and it doesn’t include our car! So it looks like we will be in the market for a different car over the next few weeks. It’s certainly not something we were planning on doing for a couple more years. We hope we can trade it in and not be set back too far financially.  In other news today, I have decided to fast from internet surfing. I have spent way too many hours just browsing and surfing.

1708471,female,indUnk,"           So today I think my number one lesson or thought was that everyone should just live life as it's given to you, don't care about what's going outside of where you are, just focus on what is going on around you at that exact moment at that exact time. That way it's so much more easier to just lay back and have fun, you don't have to worry about anything else or wonder what this somebody else is thinking about. It's so much less stressful on yourself too. I'm really screwed up though. So I finally get my guy... or have one, whatever, and like I said before I like him! But then there's still that one other guy that I've had a thing with forever, but of course it doesn't work out with him 'cause he's a jackass for the most part and he himself doesn't know what he's thinking.... but why do I still like flirt like mad with the jack and am still hesitent to really start something up with the sweetest guy in the world?! Seriously, if you have an answer to that, tell me. I always think I'm gonna have feelings for the jack guy though, especially when he's all over me, haha. I might also be like this too though 'cause I like guys....and well hell it's summer! Meh, we'll see how it all ends up after vaca.

3835942,male,indUnk,"           As if I command the sunrise and sunset, I planned to visit all over the 2nd and 3rd arrondissements of the city of paris! So I took the map which I had bought earlier and noted down the important landmarks in those areas.It read like this: 1.Notre Dame Church, 2.Beauborg district (a book said that it’s the most picturesque place in Paris), 3.Ile de la Cite, 4.Quartier Latin, 5.Top of the Eiffel Tower, 6.Ile Saint-Louis. This seems to be a short list!  When I reached Notre Dame Church it was already 1pm, since I woke up very late!  Notre Dame church is an architectural feat! And it has been carved in the early 14th century. When I was in there , I could not realize the historic importance of that building. If you do not know a bit of history of Paris and its monuments, its of almost no use visiting them except for their picturesque beauty! It has witnessed great historic moments like the crowning of King Napolean to the most recent one like the visit of King Narayan I !  I have always wondered why does a human being require an institution like religion and more strangely an institution like marriage! Its quite perplexing if I go looking for an answer! It seems to me a pre-historic question which should not be pondered upon in the post-modern 21st century where its taken for granted by majority that these institutions are indispensable part of a human life! Quite strange! But in spite of having not an answer for this question , I realize Notre Dame church epitomizes the importance given to a religion by the kings and the commons, verisimilar to the attention that the temples in south India had received.  Before getting into the church I circumambulated around the building to record its beauty. It has intricate carvings with a lot of detail. Outside the church there's a wonderful garden. Before again reaching the entrance to get into the church, I went into a small gift shop and bought some souvenirs which were quite cheap by money but pretty rich with meaning. I don’t buy things like this very often. I consider them junk .But this time they had some meaning to be transferred!  Then I went into the church. There was some prayer going on. The hall looked gloomy and tall with lot of arches on the roof. Nothing much to see inside. The carvings, a placard said were done in mid-14th century! It had those colourful stained-glass paintings. I got bored inside. Things like these look pretty outside, but internally they stink with rotten meaninglessness!  When I came out of the church it was 4pm and I had to buy vegetables and other cookeries at Gare Du Nord and had to visit the top of the eiffel tower. I had to ditch the idea of visiting all other places since that shopping will take a couple of hours and I should be there at the top before sunset to capture the view both at daylight and artificial lights. I went to the Eiffel tower. There was a huge rush and I thought it would take a couple of hours to even get the ticket and then ditched that idea too and went to Gare du Nord, bought some vegetables and returned to the room.  But amidst these I roamed around the Beauborg district , before going to Eiffel tower. As far as I have seen Paris and that place, its certainly not the most picturesque one! Bastille seems to be a very good place, with peaceful gardens, to live at.  When I was walking along these streets I saw an old woman who looked like some 40 years old. She was almost half-naked and with a lot of facial make-up. At the first sight I thought she was waiting for somebody, just like anybody else and my pace of walk was quite normal. Then within another furlong, I saw another woman in the same state. Another one...another one...Now I realised who they were!! Some were young too! I had a lot of money in my pocket. There's nobody in that part of the world who would recognize my identity. All alone in that atmosphere! I could do it if I want! Then a strange fear crept inside my mind. I cannot explain to myself why I felt like that. Freedom and fear, I thought are quite opposite. But here I experienced both these seemingly mutually exclusive emotions at once. That increased my pace of walk. I got out of that place as soon as I can! Even now I feel that pace!  There was another incident which affected me this day. When I was metro-ing towards Eiffel Tower I guess, there came a violinist-beggar inside the cabin where I was sitting. By now, I am used to these metro-beggars who play some music and ask for money and the kind of body-build and the faces and eyes they possess. Opposite to me there sat a man whose eyes cannot concentrate on a place for long. His hair was disheveled and his eyes rotund. He was holding a new tome in his hand. I could read from his face that he doesn’t have what it takes to read a book! He opened the book and started reading. Within a second he flipped through the pages and looked at me who was staring at him! He kept on flipping the book like that as if he lost his golden ring somewhere in between the pages! My guess was right! He cannot read a book.  In the meanwhile the violinist had been playing his tune. His eyes looked quite strange. There was no sign of begging. He was adroit with that instrument. But this is not unusual since he might have played the same piece of music a thousand times before. His face impressed me. He looked like a normal guy who might as well be working as a software engineer! I felt from his eyes that he could take up my job and he would do better than myself and definitely I cannot play that violin like that! He ended his play. Took out a ticket pocket that we have for having our photo and the monthly pass and used it to collect the coins that people gave him. The train stopped at the station where I had to get down. I took an euro and gave it to him! I still cant believe that I dropped an euro to a beggar. I had never dropped a coin to a beggar even in India! If you have read and digested Ayn Rand, a beggar cannot impress you. And if you are impressed by one, he cannot be a beggar! I was sure that he didn’t want money just to exist but to live. So I decided so. He too got down in the same station and I asked him to pose for a photo. He did and eagerly looked at the image I had captured in the camera. He said 'merci' and walked away without turning back. I took the map to read about the next train I had to take. I could not read it. My throat was choked with a heavy heart.I sat in the nearby bench and tears started oozing out of my eyes.I somehow controlled them so that they do not wet my sweater! It took me some time to get back to normal. There is something really wrong with either that fellow or the society in which he lives.  The day ended with these many things worth recording!  The next day I decided to take a walk along the banks of river seine. This river is seen as the reason for the birth of this historic city. I hoped that the sceneries would be good to  capture. Unusually, I was not dismayed. I started at the station of Gare de Lyon and from there started walking along the banks. Surely the panoramic views with the bridges, the Notre Dame church and the Eiffel Tower far away, is a sight that one should not miss. It was so beautiful. I could not believe in that heavenly beauty. What a fantastic scene! I tried my level best to capture them in my camera.  Along the banks of the river are the church and the Concierge building and Musee de Orsay museum and if we cut a little bit farther from the banks then and there we can see good monuments (of whose identity I am unaware) and pillars and statues. I came to the church and thought of getting inside again!  There are a lot of second-hand book sellers along this bank near the church who also sell paintings and covers of old magazines and posters of historic importance. There were a lot of books, but very few in English.  I saw a couple of pictures of Einstein with his quotes: 'Imagination is more important than Knowledge' 'If you have trouble with your Mathematics, do not worry. I have greater ones with mine!' Coincidentally, the day the 14th of March was Einstein's birthday. I thought he is right. A man can live a life without knowledge. Its no sin. But if he is living without imagination and artistic expression then he's no more a human being. I thought, 'Knowledge is Present. Imagination is Future'.  Just before the entrance I saw a man who was inviting people to be drawn as caricatures of themselves. I thought its a good idea to have a caricature of myself drawn. After a bit of argument that guy settled for 10 euros.Surprisingly, I said ,'Go Ahead'! I sat before him for some 10 minutes. He asked me to look at the side to get a good view of my facial features. I could see the picture he was drawing in his glasses! 'Where are you from? London?', he asked! 'India'. 'What are you doing? Student?' 'Software Engineer'. I felt a bit strange. When I look myself in the mirror I cannot believe that I am a software engineer. The notion of a student is, I think, better suits me and well deserved, because I have a lot to learn. He finished it and it was not what I wanted. I said thanks to him. Took a picture of him. While walking back to home , I tore away the picture and deleted his photo from my camera, since I didn’t like the thing! I cursed myself for wasting 10 euros just like that. I thought I would like a portrait of myself rather than a caricature which follows the whim of the artist.  While taking a walk inside the church, looking for anything that I had missed the last day. The same boring religious drawings and paintings! But still the church from outside is worth looking at!  After walking along the banks for a few hours, I returned to my room to re-fuel myself. Then I went to the Eiffel Tower to go to the top of it. I thought there would be  a mad rush since its Sunday and I was there around 5pm so that I could watch Paris from the top of it. To my surprise there were few people. In another half-an-hour I went to the top. I am an acrophobic and I was alone! I thought that anyway even children are there and there would be enough safety measures. There were and I didn’t feel any fear at the top. I discovered that my fear is not the height itself, but in climbing the height. Since it was inside a lift with lot of people , I didn’t feel the fear. But I could not take the stairs due to that fear!  At the top of the Eiffel tower, the view although not as beautiful as anything as looked at from the ground, it was a good one. Nothing special about Paris. I thought if Bangalore had an Eiffel Tower then it might look as good too! The only thing worth capturing from that height is the flow of the river Seine. I waited for skyline to get dark. Unfortunately it was a cloudy day and I could not see the sunset properly. It was really chill and very windy at the top. But I was there for around 3 hours just to see Paris, the city of lights, lit. It drizzled a little too!  After it got dark completely, and when the whole city was lit, it was a good sight to behold. But its very difficult to capture those details in a camera. But I tried. And in that chill breeze, even though I was wearing woolen gloves, my fingers were trembling and the pictures I was taking, shaking! I would go to a calm place there, warm myself, take a picture and then go back!  I cannot forget the couples who kept on kissing each other standing at the zenith of the tower. I wondered why do they come to the top of the tower and try this stunt in this unbearable weather. They could very well do that in the warmth of their bedrooms with much more savour! I am kind of getting really annoyed of these French kisses. Indeed, couples who travel in metros do not waste their time. They keep kissing , happily ignoring the public. I kind of like that care-free attitude. To watch a beautiful couple kiss each other at such close quarters, as inside a lift, within a feet away from you, is a sight to be savoured every second! A note of a trip to Paris is not complete if it doesn’t talk about the French kisses, I guess! So now I have done that!  After taking enough of pictures, I came down.  So this weekend ended this way!  I think slowly the Paris-fever is running down!          "

For those of you who don't know, I spent seven long, dark, dismal months looking for a job. For those of you unfortunate enough to have lived through an extended period of unplanned joblessness, you know the drill. Darkness. Dispair. etc., ad nasuem, without end. I finally landed one in October, and was happy to begin the long process of rebuilding my work self-esteem. It's a job, even if it is a contract job. Even if the contract ends 31 December. It's a job. With a paycheck. I am happy.  So it was with the most wonderful sense of irony and wonderment at how Life can sometimes work out that I found myself yesterday driving a candy apple red Camero convertable down the Nimitz Highway toward my hotel on Waikiki Beach on a sunny Saturday afternoon. Honolulu for New Year's Eve. Yes, kids, through no effort of my own, I made a withdrawal from my burgeoning account at the Karma Bank.  And the icing: the per diem rate here is $78 a day.  If someone has a place to post them, I'll send pictures of Pearl Harbor when I go.  Happy New Year to all.   P.S.

883178,male,Fashion,"           I had another weekend of music combined with some liberal politics, fresh air, beer-drinking, and frisbee. We headed up to the Green Man Festival in Duluth on Friday afternoon and were greeted by throngs of hippies camping out at the festival for the weekend. My version of camping out was booking a hotel room for under $100/night. The festival was kind of dead since Willie Nelson (the headliner for the fest) cancelled at the last minute, but we stayed anyway and played glow-in-the-dark frisbee and stopped at some political and environmental booths and drank Rolling Rock and ate Jamaican jerk chicken. Spirit Mountain was a cool-ass place to throw this party (what a view of Duluth and the lake below!), but unfortunately hippies are no good at running events of this magnitude. Their hearts were there, but the business acumen was definitely lacking. I'd love to whip that group into shape and take over this event for next year. Alas, I have this other crappy day-job to attend to.   Cracker was great, aside from the drunk fool who stood next to us and requested (more liked bellowed) 'Low' after each song. We also watched this really impish, quirky folk singer named  urlLink Haley Bonar . Not bad at all.   Saturday was spent driving along the North Shore and stopping for smoked fish and seeing the lighthouse and waterfall. We stayed at the festival until about 10:30pm and then drove back to the TC (after first stopping at Black Bear casino to try and get a room and some nickel slot gambling in - no vacancy).   Sunday night was First Ave's  urlLink Rock for Democracy  show. All proceeds from tickets, T-shirts, etc went to the DFL party and they had tables scattered throughout the club to register voters. (Duf, I'm  this  much closer to voting for Kerry, I swear.) Mayor RT Rybak was there wearing a Wellstone T-Shirt. Before the Flops hit the stage, he gave a little speech about getting the current guy out of office, etc, etc...and then he did a stage dive into the crowd. He said he wanted to be the first mayor ever to stage dive at First Ave. So excellent. The Jayhawks all showed up at the last minute to play a 20 minute set. Dave Pirner (formerly of Soul Asylum, now Golden Smog, sans dreads) walked on-stage during Jessy Greene's set and sang a fantastic rendition of 'Black Gold'. Dan (Semisonic) and Matt Wilson (the  urlLink Flops ) sang 'Made to Last' together. It was local music overload (in a GOOD way).   *whew*              "

The most substantial drop in insurance during 2001 took place among people who had been getting health benefits through their jobs, particularly in small companies, the Census Bureau figures show. The pool of people with no outside help in paying their medical bills -- 41.2 million last year -- would have been even larger, except that government insurance programs absorbed more residents who are poor.  The portrait of the nation's supply of health insurance is the second significant piece of new evidence to indicate that the weakened economy is having adverse ripple effects on ordinary people -- and could have political repercussions. Last week, the Census Bureau reported that the proportion of Americans living in poverty rose last year for the first time since 1993, while the income of the middle class dipped for the first time in a decade.  Health insurance is widely considered a prerequisite of adequate medical care.  A spectrum of health policy experts predicted that the erosion of coverage in 2001 foreshadows a more dramatic drop-off this year and, perhaps, next. They noted that the forces that are straining the availability of insurance all have intensified in the past year. Those include rising unemployment, rapid medical inflation, and a growing number of states in which public insurance programs are outpacing budgets.  'This is not a blip. This is something we are going to see get worse and worse over the next several years,' said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a liberal health care lobby.  A decade ago, the plight of the uninsured was a dominant political theme. Recently, political debate over health care has focused mainly on narrower questions, such as how to help the elderly pay for prescription drugs and how to protect patients in private health plans.  Word of today's impending news from the Census Bureau prompted calls late last week for federal action -- but little agreement over what the government should do. The Bush administration immediately urged Congress to approve health insurance tax credits and bigger subsidies for community health centers -- aspects of the president's budget proposal last spring that are largely favored by conservatives.   Meanwhile, an eclectic coalition of organizations, led by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and endorsed by former presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, announced plans for a 'Cover the Uninsured Week' next March, which will include hundreds of events across the country to draw attention to the issue. The coalition includes major representatives of business, the insurance industry, labor unions, and providers and consumers of care.  Still, there remains uncertainty that the government will address the problem thoroughly -- or soon. 'We couldn't do anything about this when we had huge surpluses, so it's going to be that much harder to do with deficits,' said Paul Fronstin, an analyst for the Employee Benefits Research Institute.  The census figures are based on interviews with people in 78,000 households through the annual Current Population Survey, who were asked whether they had insurance at any time during 2001. In today's report, the number of uninsured people for 2000 appears larger than reported a year ago -- 39.8 million, instead of 38.7 million -- because the figures were adjusted based on the most recent census.  Overall, the findings show that the percentage of uninsured people rose last year to 14.6 percent, from 14.2 percent in 2000.  The proportion of people who get insurance through their jobs dropped for the first time since 1993, from 63.6 percent in 2000 to 62.6 percent. This drop was almost entirely attributable to a decrease in employment-based coverage at companies with 25 or fewer employees. Coverage among workers at larger companies did not change.  Notably, the ranks of the uninsured grew among people ages 25 to 64, but not among very young workers who historically have relatively low rates of coverage. 'The significant thing is, [the increase in the uninsured] is in those prime working years,' said Charles Nelson, the Census Bureau's assistant division chief for income, poverty and health statistics.  Outside analysts attributed that pattern to decisions by some small employers to stop offering insurance as it has become more expensive, combined with decisions by some workers to drop coverage as their companies have required them to pay a greater share of insurance costs.  The data show that a lack of insurance became slightly more common among men and women. The proportion of uninsured children did not change, remaining at nearly 12 percent, or 8.5 million youngsters. Among poor children, more than 1 in 5 remained uninsured, even though more of them were enrolled last year in government programs -- Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program.  A scarcity of insurance remained concentrated in parts of the population in which the problem has long been most acute. Fully one-third of Latinos lacked coverage, far more than any other racial or ethnic group. More than 4 in 10 residents who are not citizens were uninsured, compared with slightly more than 1 in 10 people born in the United States. And more than one-quarter of high school dropouts had no insurance, compared with 7 percent of those who are college graduates.  Locally, Virginia had fewer uninsured residents last year than in 2000, while there was little change in Maryland or the District. The proportion of people without insurance was 11.3 percent in Virginia and Maryland and 13.4 percent in the District. But roughly 1 D.C. resident in 6 relied on Medicaid, far more than in either neighboring state.     2002 The Washington Post Company          "

Narcissistic, the guy is Narcissistic! So I try to be friendly; mind you, did he not just have dinner with me a week ago?  Did I just not talk to him LAST MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDS, and did he not just call me on Thursday?  And he can't remember my voice???  Ok, I was calling from the cell, and yes I have a freaking cold, but still... He didn't know who I was???? A complete blank???  He told me that our mutual cannot rely on me for help, and that it was nothing that I did wrong... I didn't think I had done anything wrong! I should have said, K--'You know, if you don't try to belittle me or insult me it will be a first!  In fact, every time I talk with you, you have something really crappy and demeaning to say!' Oh, But what the hell is his problem?   I shall not ascend to his greatness no doubt--the enlighend one indeed!  Ah, he really troubles me; he works me all up for nothing! I feel like crying over this complete ASSHOLE!  He's not even worth my tears!  Ok, back the phone coversation; So the mutual is stressing out in the back ground while I'm talking on the phone.  So I say, 'I'll call you tomorrow... What time is good for you?'  He gives tons of explanations, and lets not forget how my phone call would interfere with his damn swimming... 'I have to go swimming...' Does he want me to be proud of him because he goes swimming?  Like his stupid, long and lanky body could use the muscle building!    Nevertheless, I said, '7:30.' He said, 'I have my daughter..' What difference does that make?  We're not going to have phone sex!  I said 'I don't want to leave a message...' He said, '7:30 that should work...'  Did he not suggest to me on weds of last week that I might call him for next week for this very reason?  And now it is a little game?  Jumbled Chaos indeed!  He's putting me on the rack!  I don't feel my age.  I feel like a sixth grader. And the worst part about it is that I know he doesn't care if I call him or not.  This man delights not in me! All of this TRAUMA he is putting me through, and it doesn't touch him one way or another...  How does one live his life like that?  Just absoultely numb to the vivacity around him? I don't get how he could be absoultely numb to this passionate, youthful, feminine, sexy, creation fluttering around him! Don't get me wrong, I'm not flaunting myself; I haven't sat on his lap.  I haven't been agressive.  But I have been simply me, and that energy I carry with me is undeniable.  I know my own strengths!   Usually, I am so noticed... Not that I look for it, but it is just always there.  He's working me up to no end.  I don't want to talk to him anymore!  But in this instance I had to for the sake of the mutual.  It was a mutual intervention if you will... I have to talk to him tomorrow, and I'm going to be BOTHERED all day about it!  But K--he's probably not even worrying either way...  I feel like telling him: 'You know, I don't expect you to remember my voice... It doesn't sound like yours!'  No narcissus, it doesn't sound like yours!  He's conceited.   I'm not competing with him. I hate competition!  I'm not a game player. He's got a chip on his shoulder.  And maybe that's where I feel sorry for him.  'Pathos' he said at dinner.  I don't want people to feel 'Pathos for me'... Well, I DO feel sorry for him!   I can't help it!  He's stuck on himself.  He's got a cold and rotten temperament.  He's selfish, and dark!  He doesn't know what he wants; he's on a search. And when your searching for what you dont know, you end up with what you don't want...   'Oh, I am Fortune's Fool!'  You know when EB, beautiful EB, exited my life, I told him, 'I am never going to be this close to your lot Again.'  I meant it! I passed my education, away from the like.  And with K, it is the same thing.  I am never, ever, going to be in contact with the like! You see, maybe I have this wierd twisted fetish for men like this?   And here I go, breaking everything down, analyzing it, for NOTHING!!! I am happy. I love my life.  I just don't speak his language. I said that to him too. 'I don't speak your language,' and he spoke to me in Thai, so I spoke back to him in French!    He has to compensate for his cantankerous personality through this illusion of good looks!  I saw his picture tonight; the mutual showed it to me.  I just looked at him, and I saw a very old man!  In the sense that e.e. cummings writes; 'When men insist they are always right, then they are old.'  I can't touch that; I can't break through that!       I don't want to either!

Here are ten of us, pitch black, crystal clear night, about 25 degrees. We know there are bad guys in  the area, a few shots have been fired but no big deal. We decide that we need air cover and the only thing in the area is a solo B-1 bomber. He flies around at about 20,000 feet and tells us there is nothing in the area. He then asks if we would like a low level show of force.  Stupid question. Of course we tell him yes.  The controller who is attached to the team then is heard talking to the pilot. Pilot asks if we want it subsonic or supersonic.  Very stupid question. Pilot advises he is twenty miles out and stand  by.    The controller gets us all sitting down in a line and points out the proper location.  You have to picture this. Pitch black, ten killers sitting down, dead quiet and overlooking this about 30 mile long valley.  All of a sudden, way out (below our level) you see a set of four 200' white flames coming at us. The controller says, 'Ah-- guys-- you might want to plug your ears'. Faster than you can think a B-1, supersonic, 1000' over our heads, blasts the sound barrier and it feels like God just hit you in the head with a hammer'.

4286351,male,indUnk,        This is the first post on this blog. I wana hear what u think about the latest movements in the NBA      
4192173,male,Technology,"             I keep talking about how we are in the home stretch, and while these songs are pretty much up to snuff and just need drum edits before mixing, one song, called one.nine.five.six (which I'll herein refer to as 1956) has plagued us. It's been through several arrangement changes, and everyone has had a feeling for sometime that this track was not quite there yet. So now, thanks to our newest addition Charles breathing new melodic life into the song by adding some new basslines, I was now ready to tackle Track 2 of the new Hypefactor album, which by the way, is the angriest, heaviest song HF has ever done, and will appeal to the few aggression fans who might pick this record up someday.  This song was intended to be our Primal Scream homage. And while it's still a nod to Booby G and co, I decided to loosen the reigns while molding this song into shape. Again, kudos to Charles for his solid work the other night. Because of him, I was able to blow this tune wide open. The track is very loop-based and repetative in nature, so I decided to go over all of these parts with a fine comb. Doing so, I found that these verses could be cut in half without losing the intensity of the song. Originally, the song opened with a quick POW, similar to the aggression's CHEMICAL SUN or Primal Scream's MISS LUCIFER, but after going through these loops, we found several loops and feedback guitar (and of course some of Charles' bass) that I loved and was able to turn these into a cool new intro . B and I agreed that the intro should remain loop based so when the song starts, the impact of the drums guitars will hopefully knock the listener on their ass. At least that is the intention.  During all this, Brandt's musical brain was working overtime and we tracked some new melodic guitars to put over the non-vocal verses. That nailed it as far as I was concerned.   And by the time it was over, 1956 had evolved into something new and exciting. It's in good enough shape for me to now lay down some vocals this coming week, but don't be surprised that once we have the vocals and live drums edited in that this song goes through another draft (mostly because there are so many loops that can probably be removed once Robin's drums are in). Not bad for a song that started 2 years ago with the aggression fooling around with laptops and guitars in my parents living room.  SPEAKING of the aggression, they will have a CD out in early 2005 featuring 14 (mostly unreleased) remixes from the course of their entire history. I'll get further into this as time progresses and details have emerged, but as Dan Hamill says 'Nostalgia is IN'. It is nice though to meet people who appreciate the aggression and their body of work and who want to hear more.  Keeping it old school I-Rock, The MOGpac at Skinny Puppy tomorrow and Monday, look for us. I'm the one with the beard (facial hair, not Ash)  F         "

3022585,female,Education,"       I'm funny.  Ask my friends; they'll tell you I'm funny.  It's my thing, my party trick.  I come from a long line of funny people.  No, none of them are famous.  We're funny the way your family is funny.  The way you take family or friendly information and turn it around, spin it on it's head, give it a sarcastic tone or link it to a historical travesty and spit it back into the air.  My relatives have dry and sarcastic one-liners down to a science.  It's like a racket ball game when we are gathered together. The puns and witty observations fly so fast you’re not sure you can hurl them back, but then, you do, you always do.  And so, I find friends who can play this game, who can come together in one accord on making fun of the world and each other.    Friday night, sitting amongst a group of co-workers for 'happy hour' I was anything but happy.  Oh, I was jovial and jokey and witty and brilliant, but somewhere along the line I realized that this wasn't the real funny me.  I had to work hard that night to tone my references down and to pull what little information I knew about these people to the front of my brain.  I've only worked with them for 6 months and this is only the third large group social thing we've done.  There is a few staff I know really well and with them I can joke all day, there is enough reference material there, but when you stick me with a large group of people I only see in the hallways I can't do much.      My jokes on Friday landed on unfertile ground.  There were some hits, but mostly misses.  When you don't know the people well, you're jokes and puns and one liners have to come from outside the group, I usually choose current events, historical events, local events, world events, OK so anything really.  But I'm sad to say I don't think my audience understood my references.  There was a discussion of a painting in the Mexican restaurant, which was of a man holding his own head.  I said I thought it was John The Baptist and then asked whose name was signed.  It was Raphael.  I stated again that I was pretty sure it was John The Baptist.  A co-worker said, 'Is it a religious thing?'  'Um,' I thought, 'I give up.'   Then there was my self-deprecating comment when another co-worker asked if I had gone to VCU with him, that I looked like someone in his ethics class.  I stated that I had no ethics, so no, I didn't go to VCU.  He didn’t bowl over with laughter.  'What’s wrong with you?' I thought and then realized I don't really know these people.    Sometimes I don't want to spend all that time it takes to get to know people, I just want it to be immediate.  My cousin's wife was telling me about a dinner party she and 5 other women have every month.  They get together and discuss politics by having various members' research topics then they come together to discuss.  She said she thought of me and that this is something right up my alley.  Well, after tonight and the failed attempts at garnering some sort of recognition for my brilliant repartee, I think she is right.  I need some good conversation, I need some deep thinking, I some cognitive stimulation.           "

766556,female,indUnk,"        Random bits & pieces  First off, I think I may have figured out a way to fit yoga AND meditation into my daily schedule.  I've been working in one or the other for the past few weeks, and my yoga is really suffering.  Last night, I managed to do both before bedtime, and it felt great.  So, I'm putting both on my daily agenda; now if only my little diva-ettes will cooperate by going to bed on time...  I took my now 11 year old diva-ette, along with 5 other 10-11 year old girls, to see Hidalgo on Saturday night.  No, it wasn't penance for my sins, it was a birthday party for my daughter.  It was a lot of fun actually, and I really enjoyed the movie on many levels.  There were some subliminal messages that I got from it, like comparing the 'Arabians' to the American Indians, and the lack of knowledge about the culture creating hatred for that culture.  And, finding yourself, being true to yourself... so many levels to appreciate.  The girls liked the horses. :p  And, they've installed monitoring software on the internet here at work, so that may mean fewer installations.  I know... I know... you're wondering how will you ever live  without your diva.  But, have no fear, dear reader.  I'm working on getting internet at home (which will probably end up being monopolized by the above-mentioned 11 year old).  So, when I should be doing my down-dogs, I may end up blogging instead.  And, one last note; I saw two things downtown on Saturday morning that I've never seen before.  Not counting the new farmer's market, I saw several 'Help Wanted' signs in shop windows, and I saw an overhead construction walkway, encompassing one whole street corner.  To me, these are indicators of growth in the area.  Downtown hasn't seen growth in many many years.  It was just a place to get the occasional bargain, but never considered a serious business/shopping/entertainment area.  With new businesses, growth in current businesses, new construction of housing; Downtown is fast becoming a really great place to live.  Diva out.         "

This question is always so hard for me.  There are so many different reasons to meet people.  For golf, I would pick Tiger Woods, Jesper Parnevik and Meg Mallon.  Philosophically, I would want to meet Jesus, Martin Luther or Ralph Waldo Emerson.  Politically, I would love to meet Jimmy Carter, Winston Churchill, Woodrow Wilson or Saddam Hussein (I would at least TRY to reason with the man).  Artistically, I would want to meet Glenn Gould, Jimmy Hendrix, John Updike, Richard Ford or the poets A.R. Ammons and Galway Kinnell.   For dinner, I would want to meet Gertrude Stein, Big Ernie Hemingway (pig on a spit?), Malcolm X and Bill Clinton.  Romantically, I would want to meet Audrey Hepburn (circa 1960), Amanda Plummer (dont ask) Anjelica Huston, Ariana Huffington, Halle Berry, Parker Posey, Bjork, Condolezza Rice or Faye Dunaway (circa 1960).   But, with only one choice, the person I would most like to meet would be Krzystzof Kieslowski the Polish film director.   2. If you had to live in a different century, past or future, which would it be?    This may be lame or boring (how could it be more boring than my last answer, I know, I know, but wait), but, as an AfAm, I definitely would not go backwards.  I also feel that, overall, we get worse globally with each passing year.  I am a bit of a Luddite and I think technology makes us worse, not better.  So, I would pick the present century.     3. If you had to move anywhere else on Earth, where would it be?   I would move to Scandinavia or Canada.  I am politically more in line with folks there, and I think that in terms of quality of life, they are on par with or better than America (unless you count culture and food).  But I would hate to move.  I am proud to be an American, and I feel really lucky to be born here instead of many other places.     4. If you had to be a fictional character, who would it be?    Easy, Atticus Finch from To Kill A Mockingbird.   5. If you had to live with having someone else's face as your own for the rest of your life, whose would it be?   Tyson, the Ralph Lauren model.          "

1415200,female,Student,"       Today was a torment, of my own hell. I havent been this confused, for over a year now. and just when I think that things are beginning to look up for me..BAM! things just hit me like a train, and I dont know what to do.. I cant just tell people my confusion, first of all, they most likley dont care and just want some dirt to burn me with later, and if they do care, they have no clue of what to say, or do to help me, which to me is absolutly pointless. So I have to sit here completly alone, and try and console myself through this, before someone makes a move. I dont want anyone to make a move..I dont want to have to regret any of my actions. I dont want to be forced into a decision I dont think I can full heartily make. Especially because I know how it feels and I dont want to be the reason for another broken heart.  I dont think I could put either one of them through that. Plus there best Friends. Now, how am I supposed to deal with that. If I would do anything with one, they would probably just turn around and go tell the other, and vice versa. And I know that that feels like an extreme kick to the chest. I wish that this would all go away. I even felt like going away to some far off place and putting thisall behind me, that way they would both come out even. Because neither one of them is better than the other.  I cant keep this all in my head though..I might just go completly insane and up a wall if I would. And for fear of someone involved in this, reading this, and getting more info then what I need for them to have, I cant write anything that they can take out of context. So to save myself from more of a head ache, and more pain..Im going to stop here..and if I can I'll write later.  pain is inevitalbe, misery is optional...enjoy the ride.    "

She went into the bathroom and didn't come out till quite some time. Pastor then asked her did she floss out the food particle and she said yes. Then, handed the dental floss string back to Pastor and said 'I washed it many times already. Return to you.'  hahahhahaha...some ulu kampong girl....

The stuff he plays swerves through this song like a bird. Well done and kudos to Jason for bringing Russ in.  A rough version of www.hypefactor.com is back up and running. I have some new designs for it that should hopefully go up soon as well. Brandt should be appearing on here soon to give more perspective to all things Hype.  I refuse to discuss my utter dislike for THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN. Anna Poontang is responsible, though I would have seen the movie eventually. I'm dying to see PIRATES. Hopefully I won't be disappointed.  Back to the mixes and then a mogpac reunion..at a retirement home. ;-)  F             "

1463590,female,Education,"                 Mood: Hinata-Mode    I'm off to Nagoya this weekend.  I'm cosplaying Hinata this time. The third and last of the aforementioned 'set'.  (see below post) unfortunately I don't have the right stuff to make the Byakugan veins.  I'm going to get some of the stuff AFTER the con, I think that's irony.  I was reading a blog today, and it really struck me how lucky I am that my friends are who they are.  It strikes me a lot actually, I just would never have written it down before I got this blog last May.  It was someone I know back home, but noone that reads THIS blog me thinks, and it struck me because of how whiney they were.  Now, you may be confused at that, but this person isn't one of my friends, just a friend of a friend in a technical sense.  It was one of those moments where you get an insight into how petty people can be, and how some people can take every tiny thing that happens and make it bad so that its one BIG bad thing.  Then, because of that, they think the world is horrible to them and that  all people other than themselves are idiots .  That's really what bugs me, I  HATE  that attitude. You know them, the person who is complaining (maybe not ALL the time) but instead of sympathy you just look and think 'what?' Some people really DO have big bad things happen to them, and they might complain too, but I can be glad that they don't make a habit of writing off all the people who cause the problems as 'just idiots' or 'uninformed'. As a matter of fact I have learned so many things about positive coping with things from Shannys blog, its not even funny.  Id like to think that we know enough to say that they're idiots but people too.  I realize that it's too easy to belittle how other people feel because you aren't the one feeling it, but I also really respect people who can come to terms with the idea that EVERYONE has a brain, even if you don't see it most the time.  Gah, sorry to rant guys, but it does bug me when I see that part of some peoples personalities.  Makes me want to turn away and wait for them to move on.  Luckily,  I CAN !   WOO!    Wow this is starting to be a very long post, and you have to read through all my hate the bitches stuff just to get down to the good stuff.  Well... that would make   this   the good stuff, and I 'm not really sure I can assert that with any confidence. I CAN use large and metagrobolizing language to state it though!   ...yes, I looked up that word.  What, do I look like Jen?  Bet she even knew what that WAS!  It means confusing.  P.S.

883178,male,Fashion,"            F-f-f-f-f-f-friday F-f-f-f-f-f-ive in DJS Quadraphonic Stereo    1. Who is your favorite celebrity?  Always a tough question...because from what realm of fame dost thou choose?  Music?  Movies?  TV?  Well, since TV sucks, I can omit that realm.  Let's see...I guess I'm going to have to go with Bjork.  I know...it was a given, but when I really think about it, there's no one else that I'll drop whatever I'm doing to watch if I see a video of hers or an interview or whatever.  I'll even admit to getting into a bidding war with some Kraut over an picture of her framed with an autographed CD in there.  The final price ended up being $312.00.  Guess who won???   2. Who is your least favorite?  I've got a bunch.  Here goes (in no order)  1. Oprah Winfrey (see earlier posts) 2. Dick Clark (there's a reason people call him 'Dick') 3. Jennifer Garner (have no idea why she's famous) 4. Horse-faced Julia Roberts (no talent, big-toothed psychopath) 5. Bill Cosby (mugging, annoying, holier than thou jello-eating jerk) 6. Dave Matthews (yodeling frat-boy rock idiot) 7. J Lo (phony, over-exposed head-case) 8. Sean Connery (egotistical wife-beating drunk) 9. Rosie O'Donnell (head like a medicine ball, loud-mouth freakshow) 10. Avril Lavigne (it upsets me that I even know her name) 11. Michael Jordan (retire for good, you has-been) 12. Dale Earnhardt Sr. & Jr. (one down, one to go) 13. Justin Timberlake (I want him dead.  get an identity, white-boy) (to be continued)   3. Have you ever met or seen any celebrities in real life?  Yep.  I've met Brendan Fraser (nice guy), Uma Thurman (she touched me 3 times), Timothy Hutton (asked me how I was doing), Michael Rappaport (prick), Steven Wright (my mom embarassed him in an elevator), Emilio Estevez (bumped into him), Joel Coen (shook his hand and introduced myself).  People I've just seen: Natalie Portman, Martha Plimpton, Queen Latifa, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jean Claude Van Damme, Joe Pesci, Joshua Jackson, Linda Hamilton, James Cameron, Kid (from Kid N Play) there might be some more but I can't think of 'em.   4. Would you want to be famous? Why or why not?   I don't know if I'd want to be famous because t would suck for everyone to know who you are.  The minute you do something stupid, everyone knows about it.  I guess I wouldn't mind being well-known, you know?  Like if one of my books takes off and people on the street say 'Hey, aren't you the guy who wrote...?'  That would be pretty cool, I reckon.  Yeah.  Well-known.  That'd be all right with me.  Oh...and rich, too.   5. If you had to trade places with a celebrity for a day, who would you choose and why?  We did this question already, but I'll pick someone different this time.  I'd want to trade places with Steven Speilberg.  In one day, I'd green-light all the projects that came over from a certain DJS and I'd ask him if I could buy the rights to his children's book so that I could make it into a blockbuster family film.  If I was Steven Speilberg, I'd avoid Kate Capshaw...I don't know, tell her I was busy at work and wouldn't be able to come home.  That woman scares me.  Plus, she ruined the 2nd Indiana Jones movie with her horrible acting (dis)abilities.         "
1103575,female,indUnk,"       I love the sound of laughter.  It is fullbodied {like hair, or wine.}  and it makes me smile. I got the April National Geographic today. I find it interesting how open some of the people at school have become about their sexuality.  For some people I know its a personal thing, like Jessie and Camille.  I really do think they are adorable together.  but for other people it seems to have become a social thing... hey lets be bi, because we can, why should we be limited to a specific sex?  I'm not judging anyone based on this, but it bothers me that sex/sexuality has been made into such a casual thing by some people. Lately, I've been a terrible person.  Just because I have an excuse doesn't mean I should. Somethings are lovely though.  They make me happy. I think I'll go curl up in bed for a while.  I feel the consistancy of sleep fill my my veins and seep into my limbs like the sand used to hold back oncoming floods.      "
1708471,female,indUnk,"           I've always heard about Sex and the City and listened to people's rants about how good that show is. Unfourtunately, I was not able to express the same feelings seeing that I did not have access to the wonderful channel of HBO. I never really understood why people would be so infatuated with one show, but I finally figured it out.   Because my sister watched the show many times at her friends houses, she too became part of this obsessive group of wanting more 'sex in the city.' With this, our family ended up getting all the seasons on DVD. However, it was not until last night, that I decided to venture into the world of women living vicariously with sex in New York. And I now understand.   10 episodes in one day, you could call that obsessive, but really what it is, is the connection with you, that tv, and those four women 'living' out their lives. Really I think why people like it so much is because we all secertly, or not secertly, want to be like them.   Never before has sex and the city sounded so good.   Kati         "

But addNode of Node does care about that, it uses  neighborSignal[index_] and index_++, regardless how big index_ is!!!  This problem may result in modification of T_ of MobileNode class(derived from Node). So T_ is changed, you may see many error like 'Adjust position of node *'.   Especially when you use more than 50 nodes in your simulation code.  Initially, I found T_ was changed, but didn't know why. I thought it is the problem of the node-config.

3581210,male,InvestmentBanking,"             It's been a while.  Been busy.  Was entertaining a British friend of mine (originally from Manchester, now in K.L.-Kuala Lumpur) who has basically been ruined by Asia.  You see, once a Western guy comes here he can hardly go back to life in the West...you'll know if you're here.  Two other Aussie brothers I know had the same thing--they both work for investment banks in Seoul and Shanghai and speak the respective languages, to life is good for them, too.  (Same effect for Korean women who go to places like Vancouver, they can't bear to leave that place either.)  Anyways, his business partner (an Aussie) was in town with him too...first time...so we went out for a few nights.  Also, some American and a Dutch friend of mine and some Koreans wanted to go out too...and then a couple of nights for business...like I said, been busy.  We went to DaeHak-ro and had &#49436;&#54588;&#46041;&#54028; (seo-pi-dong-pa; seo=west; pi=(pi)zza; dong=east; pa=(pa)-jun, a Korean kind of omlette; together they are western pizza/eastern omlette) and &#46041;&#46041;&#51452; (dong-dong-ju,a kind of immature makkoli, or rice booze).  Man, was it goood.  The dong-dong-ju, it looks like porridge but tastes light (the porridge look is actually ice crystals held in the mixture, no idea how they make it so consistent).  On the way out I almost invariably take the subway.  It's fast, clean, convenient and is unaffected by the recent torrential downpours (it's monsoon/typhoon season here now).  It's interesting, some stations are a little micro-city with shopping areas (some really large), links to office and apartment buildings, restaurants and almost everything else.  They all have a few things in common: lockers (which I wondered about before, but now I've used them a few times to store things I bought--and at about $1 a day they're a pretty good deal), payphones (something you don't see a lot of overground), washrooms (some are better than others), a lotto booth and usually a little convenience store, gift shop, flower shop and/or food seller.   urlLink     Amenities: lockers, PC bang, escalators.   I don't know why, but many of the subway stops here are spruced up a bit.  They have things like (below) lighted signs on the air conditioner units, aquariums (they call them fishbanks here) and posters for the Seoul Subway Corp. that show scenes totally unrelated to subway travel.   urlLink     Subway Art: an air conditioner, a fishbank and a Seoul Subway Corp. poster   There's also art shows sometimes.

3644456,male,indUnk,"       From Friday's Boston Globe:     'Boston is too racist for me,'' he said. 'I couldn't play there.'    'Only what guys have said,' he said, 'but that's been going on ever since my dad [Bobby] was playing baseball. I can't play like that. That's not for me, brother.'  When it was suggested the racial climate has changed in Boston, Bonds demurred.  'It ain't changing,' he said. 'It ain't changing nowhere.'  They built a tunnel to honor Ted Williams in Boston. What did he imagine would be built for him?  'Nothing, man,' he said. 'I'm black. They don't build stuff for blacks.'  ------------------------------------------------------------  O.K., why does Barry Bonds have to go out of his way to diss my city, huh?  I'm sure if he was confronted on his improper grammer for the use of the wrod, 'ain't', he'd probably blame that on 'The Man' too.  Does Boston have racist undertones?  Yes.  Even the Red Sox do (The original owner, Tom Yawkey, was from Tennessee and a former plantation owner).  If you ever get a chance, read Boston Herald's columnist Howard Bryant's book, 'Shut Out'.  Great stuff about how the Sox were the last team in the MLB to have a black player (Yankees were 2nd to last.  You see?  We CAN beat them at something!).  That was also the famed tryout of where Jackie Robinson, Willie Mays, and Josh Gibson were on the Fenway grass and someone yelled out, 'Get those niggers off the field!'   The city itself has had a shaky history, I'll admit it.  We had the segregation of busing in South Boston during the 70's, the Charles Stewart dibacle, Bill Russell's house getting ransacked in the 'burbs, former Celtic Dee Brown being confused for a bank robber in a Wellesley bank when he was a rookie, and of course Malcolm X calling Boston, 'The most racist city in America'.    It's still somewhat uncomfortable to minorities.  Ever listen to WJAMN (Jam'n) 94.5?  Yeah, it's a 'Hip Hop' radio station not owned or run by black people.  Listen to it someday.  It shows because it sucks.  But the people in Boston arn't THAT bad!  This isn't fucking KKKtown, Arkansas.  For every one racist moment we have had, Anytown, MS has had probably around 20 to match it.  It's not like we're burning crosses on lawns or having different proms for white and black students.  Even black Boston athletes are being recieved more here than they ever have. And they feel more comfortable because of it. Look at Pokey Reese; corn rows n' all, he's by far the most popular player out of all of the new additions this year (AND that's including Schilling and Foulke).  Plus, if Barry had known Boston's history, he would have known that when the first federal census was enumerated in 1790, Massachusetts was the only state in the Union to record NO slaves.  He also said that Boston doesn't build stuff for blacks, where in fact, the African American Meeting house was built by the city in 1805 so blacks could have a church to call home (because they faced minor discrimination in white churches, and that was just by forcing them to the bleacher seats - but hey, at least the city acknowledged they're bigots!)  In addition to its religious and educational activities, the meeting house became a place for celebrations and political and anti-slavery meetings, including a famous speech by Socalist Frederick Douglas.  See, Barry?  We arn't so bad when it comes to racism!  Maybe if you came here and saw for yourself how warm of a city Boston is to minorites (And unlike in New York City, you'll even get a cab from the airport!), you would think twice about what you said.  Plus, we would EVEN build something for your arrival to prove we're not racist AND to make you feel comfortable.....  We'd build a needle.......a BIG GIANT needle.  You'll feel right at home.  Prick.         "
3357167,male,indUnk,"       saturdays and sundays are the most memorable days in the lyf of a cadet.. during these days we used to rot and make happy. During saturdays we've experienced the most tiring part of cadets lyf. During friday night cadets are sleepless preparing things, fixing the room, ironing uniform, shining shoes, shining metal parts of uniform, follow-up underclassmen and etc. We are usually doing this in preparation of barracks inspection, ranks inspection and parade and review every saturday. Every saturday is a challenge and it adds up to our prestige everytime we overcome this day. During saturday morning barracks and ranks inspection, parade and review was done. During the afternoon cadets serving punishment take a tour around the boromeo field in BDA under arms to serve their punishment. While cadets who are snappy and not defficient in academics can have a privilege to go out in baguio city to visit their friends and poster parents otherwise cadets can entertain their visitors and friends inside the portals of the academy. Last friday night i went to sleep at 0100 at woke-up at 0430. First, i fixed my bunks and take a bath. I change my uniform for the sword and rifle drill early mess at 0530. at 0600, we rehearse the whole sequence of parade and review. We went back to barracks at 0700 to finalize our things. at 0745 i change my uniform to full dress white under arms for the barracks inspection at 0800, im happy coz i don't have any report of violations and demerits. At 0845 we went outside the barracks at quezon ave. for the ranks inspection, i got one report(loose thread, hehe). We are standing under the sun for an hour and went to the slope(the starting point of the parade). Usually, we waited for a long time before the start of the parade but that tym we only have 10 minutes and the parade starts. After the parade we have our noon mess at 1130. At 1250 we have the opening ceremony of our intramurals every companies have their muses. the assigned judges selects the best muse to represent the ccafp intramurals. the hawk company muse won, she is the former miss phillipines international and at present modeling at mexico. After the ceremony at 1600, 2cl and 1cl cadets went to baguio city for inviting privilege for the upcoming formal dinner and hop on august 21. we went back to pma at 2230. During sundays we have our religious services where in cadets went to their respective churches of their religion to worship. At sunday afternoon cadets who are serving punishment once again will tour around the boromeo field while those who does'nt have punishment enjoys the rest of the weekend. This sunday after the religious service all 2cl and 1cl cadets was given privilege to visit their poster parents. And i have visited too my poster parents. Now, another weekend will pass and another academic week to face...may god bless us all, always!     "

589736,male,Technology,           preach it sister!         
589736,male,Technology,"           op ed from the ny times February 21, 2003 The Martial Plan By PAUL KRUGMAN    he Marshall Plan was America's finest hour. After World War I, the victors did what victors usually do: they demanded reparations from the vanquished. But after World War II America did something unprecedented: it provided huge amounts of aid, helping both its allies and its defeated enemies rebuild.   It wasn't selfless altruism, of course; it was farsighted, enlightened self-interest. America's leaders understood that fostering prosperity, stability and democracy was as important as building military might in the struggle against Communism.   But one suspects that our current leaders would have jeered at this exercise in 'nation-building.' And they are certainly following a very different strategy today.  It's not that the Bush administration is always stingy. In fact, right now it is offering handouts right and left. Most notably, it has offered the Turkish government $26 billion in grants and loans if it ignores popular opposition and supports the war.   Some observers also point out that the administration has turned the regular foreign aid budget into a tool of war diplomacy. Small countries that currently have seats on the U.N. Security Council have suddenly received favorable treatment for aid requests, in an obvious attempt to influence their votes. Cynics say that the 'coalition of the willing' President Bush spoke of turns out to be a 'coalition of the bought off' instead.  But it's clear that the generosity will end as soon as Baghdad falls.  After all, look at our behavior in Afghanistan. In the beginning, money was no object; victory over the Taliban was as much a matter of bribes to warlords as it was of Special Forces and smart bombs. But President Bush promised that our interest wouldn't end once the war was won; this time we wouldn't forget about Afghanistan, we would stay to help rebuild the country and secure the peace. So how much money for Afghan reconstruction did the administration put in its 2004 budget?  None. The Bush team forgot about it. Embarrassed Congressional staff members had to write in $300 million to cover the lapse. You can see why the Turks, in addition to demanding even more money, want guarantees in writing. Administration officials are insulted when the Turks say that a personal assurance from Mr. Bush isn't enough. But the Turks know what happened in Afghanistan, and they also know that fine words about support for New York City, the firefighters and so on didn't translate into actual money once the cameras stopped rolling.   And Iraq will receive the same treatment. On Tuesday Ari Fleischer declared that Iraq could pay for its own reconstruction ?even though experts warn that it may be years before the country's oil fields are producing at potential. Off the record, some officials have even described Iraqi oil as the 'spoils of war.'   So there you have it. This administration does martial plans, not Marshall Plans: billions for offense, not one cent for reconstruction.   Of course, postwar reconstruction in Europe and Japan wasn't just a matter of money; America can also be proud of the way it built democratic institutions. Alas, the Bush administration's postwar political plans are even more alarming than its economic nonchalance.   Turkey has reportedly been offered the right to occupy much of Iraqi Kurdistan. Yes, that's right: as we move to liberate the Iraqis, our first step may be to deliver people who have been effectively independent since 1991 into the hands of a hated foreign overlord. Moral clarity!   Meanwhile, outraged Iraqi exiles report that there won't be any equivalent of postwar de-Nazification, in which accomplices of the defeated regime were purged from public life. Instead the Bush administration intends to preserve most of the current regime: Saddam Hussein and a few top officials will be replaced with Americans, but the rest will stay. You don't have to be an Iraq expert to realize that many very nasty people will therefore remain in power ?more moral clarity! ?and that the U.S. will in effect take responsibility for maintaining the rule of the Sunni minority over the Shiite majority.  If this all sounds incredibly callous and shortsighted, that's because it is. But then what did you expect? This administration doesn't worry about long-term consequences ?just look at its fiscal policy. It wants its war; there's not the slightest indication that it's interested in the boring, expensive task of building a just and lasting peace.

2012853,female,indUnk,"       My birthday is coming up (23) and I am feeling very bah humbug about it. I don't really want to be older, I want to stay as I am, because I know that I am unprepared.. Coinciding with my birthday is the return of Uni and I know that it will be busy.   There's so much going on in my life right now that sometimes I feel like i can't breathe...  I went to the John Mayer concert on the weekend and in amongst the crowd (it was a sold out event) it was strange that I experienced the physicality of what emotionally and spiritually I have been feeling for awhile.   I felt cramped in, hot, like my skin couldn't breathe, and just weary overall..   But it was the best concert I have been to to date.... entirely worth it..           "

If I had those Choate, Hall & Stewart people at the beginning, I wouldn't even have gone to prison. And I learned how many people there are like me. Wouldn't hurt anybody, didn't hurt anybody, and people are spending their lives behind bars. There's no justice. But I also learned about my own strength. There are so many people who go to prison and give up, they say 'you can't beat the feds.' But I say 'fight every day,' and that's what I did. Every day, I wrote somebody about my case.

3749504,female,Student,"        Firstly, I did say I was going to write something new for Civilitas since I haven't lately, as I've been on vacation and...other stuff. But the point is I can't until tomorrow or Saturday. Why? Because I've spent the past five hours doing homework for my college History of World Civilizations class. And that's just my WEEK'S ASSIGNMENT. My class ends on Saturday and I have a final to do as well (an essay). I've left two days open to work on this, tomorrow and Saturday. I am swamped, to be frank.      In other news...she finally figured it out. That I hate soccer. She knocked on my door and said 'You have a message from Kambak. She says if you're playing soccer, you have to call her back.' Uh. So I told her very politely that no way in hell am I playing soccer; I have thought about it and decided that I am going to be very busy my senior year of high school, what with a job and my senior project and taking additional college classes, and helping run Student Bank and other such nonsense.      So she said Okay. She didn't ask me to explain or anything because she knows and  gets it now .      What else...oh yes. Added a few things to sidebar. The thing near the bottom of it is a random link to a journal through a program called BlogSnob. I can't figure out how to make the font smaller; I tried everything I could but it didn't work. Well, it worked but it just did something really weird and I had to change it back. I know people can format that thing, I saw it on other blogs, but I can't figure it out. Any suggestions?      And I put a counter at the bottom of my journal. I wanted it on the side bar but for some reason when I put it there, it drags down to the bottom of my journal and won't go where I want it. I figure there's some sort of footer code in it I can't figure out. I'm just used to java and perl :( Eh. Well, BLAH. Oh yes - and I put in a little Simpsons random quote thing. It's hilarious, well, most of them anyway.       Also, I am very depressed for a reason I'd rather not divulge. Fuck it all.      "
4000416,male,Science,       关于悉尼的生活水平之高，略有耳闻，这次终于亲身体验了一次。 从机场到预定的酒店，全程大约30分钟左右的车程，一路上计价表狂跳，到达的时候已经是60澳元了(1澳元=6.0人民币)，相比之下新加坡的车费真是便宜太多了，当初从机场到学校，还是临晨需要加价的情况下，也才20多新元(1新元=5.0人民币)。公交巴士也是新加坡的几倍，一两站就要1.6元，3，5站就2.7元；也许是因为司机的劳动量大点，需要收钱找钱。地铁更是不得了，从市中心到机场的地铁票居然要12元，快赶上直接打的了。澳洲的公交系统，真是摆明了宰人的嘛。  吃的在澳洲就更加贵得离谱了，唐人街的一碗面就是标价8元左右，如果在新加坡的话，最多4元就了不得了呀，在学校吃的话就更便宜了。怪不得我的一个自费的朋友，在墨尔本读书的，每天回家自己做饭，真是值得同情呀。  在澳洲的时间短，住的价位还是不太清楚，租房的话，一般都是120元左右一周(一个房间)。比较起来，比新加坡稍贵一点。其他的关于房价什么的，就不太清楚了，因为澳洲福利还比较好，应该会比新加坡好点。  总的来说，澳洲(或者说悉尼)生活消费实在是太高，但是收入却不是特别多，但是所幸福利还好，再加上美丽的城市风景，惬意生活也是比较畅快的。

Here's my note (reprinted):   I just had a bag of Born (and Baked) in the USA snack cookies, and they were delicious.  I actually shared them with some co-workers (keeping my calories down, you know) and we all liked them a lot.  We had a disagreement about whether the hats were separate or if they just broke off from the Uncle Sam cookies.  Could you settle this for us?  I think that the hats come separately.  Also, and this is unrelated, but we were thinking that since America is one nation under God, it might be a good idea to do a line of religious cookies.  We thought you could incorporate some images of our Lord, like Jesus, sandles, fish, wine and a crucifix.  Just an idea. Thanks and best wishes with your cookies.  Now more than ever we need to stay together as a country.   Here is my response from Trixie Fargo (no lie) at Biscomerica:   Thank you for taking the time to contact us!  We are delighted to hear that you enjoy our USA cookies.  The hat should be attached to Uncle Sam, as depicted on the front of the package.  Thank you!  Trixie Fargo   Trixie, you are wrong!

2844168,female,Marketing,"                  Tropical Adventures of the Fab Four Day #2   Wow! What a day yesterday was. We all slept REALLY well (and long!) last night. We started out early and left here by 7:00 a.m. and grabbed breakfast on the run at McD's. The only think I like at McD's is their breakfast and the McGriddles are the best! We met Uncle Dan at the gate of Animal Kingdom and he let us in. He's so cool (and not just because he gets us into Disney World!). We roamed with the wild animals until about 3 p.m. Ked commentated the whole trip on our video camera as if he was the Crocodile Hunter. I may have to put part of that on my blog soon. He was cracking us up! So after viewing lots of cool animals, a couple shows, and getting drenched on the Kali River Rapids, we headed to the Magic Kingdom.  Disney in general is such a fantasy world. Their attention to detail is amazing. They just don't build a rollercoaster and put up gates for a line. No, it's a rollercoaster inside a building that is totally themed and there's plenty of interesting things to look at while waiting in line. Everywhere I looked yesterday, someone knew that I would look there and there was something to look at, even the tiniest crook and cranny had been planned.  So we whisked our way through the majors at the Magic Kingdom - Splash Mountain, Thunder Mountain, Space Mountain, Mickey's Philharmagic, and the Haunted House. By 6 p.m. we headed the bus for MGM and dinner! We only wanted to hit the Rockin Rollercoaster and the Tower of Terror at MGM and the big event of Mickey's Fantasmic - the park's closing show. We sat in the amphitheater for about 45 minutes as more and more people flooded in. Once the place was full, someone started the wave. It always amazes me how people everywhere do the wave. Ked says it's because people like to be part of something bigger than themselves. Over and over we stood and did the wave until it finally fizzled not long before the show started. And what a show it was!! WOW! They did one of the coolest things we've ever seen. They sprayed a wall of mist and used the mist as a video screen to project a movie on. It was the coolest thing. We ended our day with a bang and then drove home and went straight to bed!! It still feels good to sit down this morning!!                  "

4036952,male,Museums-Libraries,"       I heard about a couple of jobs at work I applied for the other day. I didn't receive an interview. I'm pretty dissappointed about it, I thought my application was quite good... I was never expecting to get either of the jobs, there are people at work who definitely deserve them more than I but it is still a sensation not dissimiliar to a kick in the teeth. All my friends rallied around to make me feel better but of course when you feel like that there is very little someone can do to help. It's a matter of stewing for a few days and then getting over it, I am becoming a master this year it seems. I offered my application to my friends at work for there opinion, they all said it was pretty good, but I only got a truly honest opinion from one, my good friend anthony, he told me that while it was good, I used passive language which they warn you against, I really appreciate his honesty, you have to respect it. I think he might be one of those friends you meet rarely that you should try and hold on to for the rest of your life.. you can't waste a good friend. I actually feel the bunch of guys I've met in the last couple of years while working where I am, are the best I have ever made, they are not like some of the friends I had in high school who seem to use when appropriate and forget you at other times and I honestly don't think they ever thought about it, or the friends they are unwilling or just unable to share any emotions deeper than a bottle of beer with you.. at some point you must grow up.  I was told by Anthony the other day when he read this for the first time that adnd is an old acronym for Dungeons and Dragons dating back to 2nd Edition and that die-hards upon reading my first post would pick me up on it... and I have to say if that is so, then you really must start doing something more than dnd with your life, okay!

Peter is intentionally fucking with me to make the album tracklist a surprise, but I did figure out how it ENDS. You'll see. Irene,  upset she had missed the last show, was dead into the gig and my highlight (lo-light) was Brandt getting his ass verbally kicked by Peter by not clapping to HUDSON AND DAY. What a douche. Brandt, that is. Anyhow, another fun evening topped off by 2am cheese fries with my girl at the Gramercy. Luckily, no sign of Ryan and Parker.  Back in the real world, we made it through cold and rain to the old aggression bunker and current Ass Cobra space (aka Robin's basement) for the latest attempt at recording drums for the Hypefactor album. I won't bore you with specifics, but technical difficulties made for a half frustrating/half productive evening. However, cameos from both Ash and Matt at separate intervals helped ease the pain. Somewhere during all this I learned of a potential REAL band name for Ass Cobra, which Ash created and I think is excellent. Which is why other cobra's will probably kill this. Ash also spun some of his new Carbon Framework material, which I'm totally digging hard. This kid is on fire. Matt Gentile and I discussed the Sisters of Mercy yet again, which for some reason makes me insanely angry that the last time they put a new album out I was still in my teens.  Eventually, we got some drums down for MORNING AFTER and EXIST. I'm dead happy working with Robin, who is a great team player. She really pushes herself and you never get less than 150% from this spatula weilding skin beater. Lucky to have her. Anyway, we still have a lot of drums to do, but I think we've got the set up down and are getting more effective by the day. At this point we have drums down for 4 tracks. I think Brandt will now edit these down and then eventually we will do re-takes so its cleaner and smoother. But finally, a bit of momentum at last. Oh and more buscuits at KFC at 1am!  Also occupying my time is MOG-X. All I can say.  F         "

3869393,female,Technology,"       All these days I have been wondering about my relationships, how I went about each of them and what went wrong in each of them.  But till date, I never actually thought about what I learnt from each of them.  Thats pretty, coz as a HR person I should have actually found a reason behind the attraction towards each case...  Today while sitting at work, I was pondering over my nightmares which I have been getting for over 2 weeks on and off, and I figured, there is obviously a lack of completion in each case.  But what is it that was missing..then I realised, a lesson from them!  I think I can talk about two major learnings I have had, from all the relationships I have been involved in to date...  1.  Ethics : Every relationship is governed by certain ethics and values which bind us to our daily lives.  We cannot assume we are above or below those standards, never try to break away from those ethical standards, it will only conjure up painful moments where one will stand caught in between Morals, ethics & values on one hand vs. emotional tie ups/ commitmetns!  2.  Silence : Sometimes silence has this amazing power which can heal a lot of problems. Words said in haste, can only but wreck even small chances of fixing a pace maker to the heart of the relationship!  My sessions at yoga have made me realise this to a very good extent!  To tell you the truth, actually had a chat with a close friend of mine, who is now rocking the products world in Hyd.  He kindof made me think about a few things in my relationships, why I have been confused, why I am trying to drive at peace and not being able to reach my destination!          "
883178,male,Fashion,"            Marry Chirstmas   Yep, yep...'tis true.  I'm gonna get myself married within the next year or so, hopefully.  Here's how it went down:  A couple o' weeks ago, Laura had a dream that she didn't want to tell me about.  Of course, I bullied her into telling me anyway, figuring it was going to involve Justin Timberlake in some way, shape or form.  It didn't.  Instead, she said that she dreamt that she got a little red box for Christmas.  Since we decided that we were going to get each other anything (since we just bought our townhouse and such together) I broke the news to her that a little red box wasn't really in the cards.  She knew that and explained that was why she felt dumb bringing it up.  Meanwhile, the tiny wheels in my head spun.  On Monday, she wasn't feeling well, but being the work-a-holic that she is, decided to go into work anyway.  We drove together and since it was slow and she didn't have much to do and felt considerably worse, we went home.  Both of us.  I dropped her off so she could fire herself right into bed and I decided to go out and do a bit o' Christmas shopping.  I went to the Maplewood Mall and spent a gift certificate CK2 had gotten for me only hours earlier (for those at home keeping score, I bought the Back to the Future Trilogy on DVD) and on my way home an idea hit me.  I needed to get Laura a card for X-mas.  What was near the Hallmark in Woodbury?  Yes, friends.  The Shane Co.  I went in, saw THE ONE RING, called it 'my precious' and I was on my merry, or marry way.  I planned to give it to her in Mankato at a big family function, so I needed to carry it with me, so's I could spring it on her.  In case you were wondering, yes...it was wrapped in red.  At my parents house, my brother bought his girlfriend some earrings wrapped in an IDENTICAL box.  For a second, I thought someone had found my package and set it on the counter.  I almost shit eggrolls.  Anyway, long story short, I decided to wait until we got home to propose.  I put the ring in an antique box next to the fireplace and hinted that Santa Claus might've come whilst we were in Mankato.  She thought I was a dork and went upstairs.  After much hinting and urging, I finally got her to go downstairs and look in her shittin' stocking.  I got her some dumb stuff like an N'Sync import album, Pretty In Pink on DVD, some of those Harry Potter jellybeans, etc.  She scolded me for getting her gifts when we decided not to.  As she went to hang her stocking back up, I got on my knee near my antique box and I said, 'Oh...I think there's one more.'  She said, 'What're you doing?'   I handed her the red lil' package and she opened the sucker up.  I was kind of nervous, but I managed a 'Do you think you'd want to marry me?'  She said yes.  Best...Christmas...EVER.         "

766556,female,indUnk,"        Lost  I have somehow lost my sense of service recently, and don't know where to find it.  I am always happy to assist with any event, charity or fund-raiser and was always the team leader to organize groups here at work to get involved.  But, after trying to encourage involvement here at work in so many events to no avail, I'm starting to feel discouraged.  After my choice for location was not accepted, I have backed away from planning the employee holiday party.  My idea of the party was that it could be held in a lovely botanical garden at night, here on Miami Beach.  Outside in December in Miami is wonderful weather, generally temperatures range anywhere from 60 to 75 degrees.  We wouldn't have to pay a rental fee, saving $1500 on our limited budget.  Minimal decoration would be needed, leaving more money for food and prizes for staff.  But, someone on the committee is concerned about rain, and wants to find an indoor venue.  One that will cost more money and probably not provide the quality of food that we would get at the Garden.  This person had nothing good to say about our last employee function, but couldn't provide any good input or alternatives.  I just don't want to work with her now.  I'm not going to form a team for Hands On Miami Day on November 1st.  The last time I got involved, it was just me and one of the owner's daughters.  It was embarrassing to see that a company of 500 could only muster the energy of 2.  No one is interested, so I'm not wasting my time with them.  I'll be at Hands On Miami Day, but I'm not working to get a team together.  And I'm not even sure I want to get the two hotels involved in the Toys for Tots program this year, since there was very little participation when we did it two years ago.  But, I'm volunteering for any pick up sites that may need help.  So, maybe I haven't lost my sense of service, just my interest in getting the people that I work with involved in things they don't want to do.  I have so many other things that I can spend my energy on.  What's that bibilical saying about not throwing pearls to the pigs?  Something like that.   I feel like I'm doing something wrong, and maybe I need to get my heart back in the right place.  But for now, I just want to stick to this non-involvement.  Maybe I'm just pouting, or maybe I'm growing up a little.  Diva out.           "
883178,male,Fashion,"           Quick comment to Duf - it's clear that you don't watch enough reality television if that 'Obnoxious Fiance' show is one of the 'best tragedies ever displayed on television'.  I recommend regular viewings of 'The Bachelor(ette)' and 'The Real World' (emphasis on the Las Vegas season).  Although I didn't see any of 'MBFOF', I don't think anything there tops Trishelle having a three-way in the hot tub (with the other roommates watching) as an act of rebellion directed towards her dad.

649790,female,indUnk,"               Highlights of the Day    I streaked my hair RED!! And cut it short, till about chin-length. It was a very interesting experience at the hairdresser's, considering how it's actually a hair college - Pivot Point.   After months of looking longingly at the model on the poster at the salon, I finally did it. I love it actually...very vivid colour, and the cut's pretty good too. Everyone seems to think so (hehe), I got reviews from 'wicked!' and 'gorgeous!' to 'don't go back to long hair in a hurry!' and 'eh, quite nice ah, hor?'  Anyways, as I was saying, the hair college. This nice Korean lady, a student of course, cut me hair for me. It was an interesting experience 'coz she's only been in Australia for a year, so her English wasn't really good. We managed to communicate though. She reminded me of one of those Japanese housewives who you always see in those Jap soap dramas. I was talking to her, and found out she is graduating in December, and from there working at her mother-in-law's salon. Hmmm trying to impress the in-laws?  Well she was cutting it half-way, then her supervisor walked by, this tall hulking guy with bulging biceps, thick veins and a tight t-shirt. He took over for most of the haircut, showing her how to feather-cut my hair using a razor, an advance technique which she hadn't learnt yet. He did a pretty good job - looked nice n layered, and I think made my hair look a lil' finer. (*ahem* he also said I had great hair, and after the cut, he said I looked 'unreal' heheh....oh the praises...). I quite liked it, esp. considering I was afraid to cut too short in case it didn't fit my face shape.  The Korean lady, Jung, was also noting details about my hair in a form as we went along - a pre-requisite for the college I suppose. Flipping through it, I found out my hair is in Good Condition, Porous, and my scalp is Normal (yay, the Selsun Blue 5 for dandruff works!). And all this considering I blow-dry my hair EVERYDAY!  And the price? Are you ready for this? For a wash, cut, half-head highlights, and blow-dry, it's only $55! Fifty-five bucks! Wooohoooo!   Now if only I can get the same results the next time I return to the salon...sigh it always happens. Great the first time, but they can't seem to repeat the same thing the next time round...  After the cut, I went to Priceline and got some hair products - a bottle each of this new Sunsilk Frutrience for Coloured Hair shampoo and conditioner (which also got me a FREE Frutrience cosmetics/vanity bag) and also Wella mousse-wax. I tried the mousse just now, but it didn't have as much hold as I'd like (wanna try some funky upturned flips at the edges of my hair), so I might pop down to Priceline again and get the Styling Mud.  Well, as for tomorrow, I'd better start on that essay that's due on Monday! EEps! And I'll be busy on Saturday afternoon and a lil' on Friday too!! EEK!           "

How dare he have that weird middle bang that hangs down so far, doesn't he KNOW thats just gonna be soo ichy!?  Good thing I have lots of extra hair from when I got it cut.  I have to make a little extension thing for the middle of my bangs.    mendoukuse naaa.   PPPPPS, Everytime I say 'mendoukuse' the teacher Im talking to will say mendoukuSAI.  I think theyre trying to get me to be less crass.   For those who have no idea what I mean, mendoukuSAI is like saying, 'oh, how troublesome'  whereas mendoukuSE has more of a 'what a &#%$ing pain in the A$$ this is'-kinda feel to it.

3647746,male,Education,"           I have a new favorite website. The British newspaper  The Guardian  calls their site  urlLink   Guardian Unlimited   , which contains content beyond what they print on paper. Noteable for their news coverage from outside the American corporate media machine, but just as appealing for their British take on all things cultural, it's a great place to browse for information and entertainment.  The inspiration for this post came from reading two articles online today.   urlLink  Barred painter's open air nude show     urlLink  Naked women, cars and sports help doubles sales of mens mags    The irony, when these two pieces are juxtaposed, is so thick and delicious you can cut it with a knife and relish in licking the bowl.  Yet, what came to me when I read the second article is a much more serious issue - men being manipulated, mostly by other men. It never ceases to amaze me how transparent it all is. Dare watching commercial television for even a short while and you will be flooded with promises aimed at men that they will have more sex and more fun if they buy certain products or participate in certain activities.  Guys, wake up! Don't you see what's going on here? You are not that stupid. You are not Pavlovian dogs! Shouldn't you feel insulted, used, stereotyped? Doesn't it bother you that it's mostly men who are selling these products, trying to exploit for their own personal gain you, their fellow men and the fact that you have been conditioned to reflexively respond to images of scantily clad women, flashy cars, rich sports celebrities, etc.? Do you think they should be raking in the dough, living a life of luxury, while you shell out your hard earned cash on items you might not purchase if you thoroughly thought about the options available.  As an example and proof that I am in no way preaching a puritan lifestyle, let's look at beer.  Question: Why in the world would anyone mindlessly choose Budweiser, Miller, or Coors when they can be enjoying  urlLink  Boundary Bay  ,  urlLink  Pike  , or  urlLink  Fish Tail  ?  Answer: Boundary Bay, Pike, and Fish Tail will not use sexual or other manipulative imagery to sell their products. Oh yeah...and they actually taste good too.   (While some would argue that another main reason for choosing Bud, Miller, and Coors is that they are cheaper, I would respond that men could easily afford the more expensive brews if they weren't blowing so much money on all the other stuff they've been manipulated into buying.)   So, my fellow male Homo sapiens, rise above your caveman roots and join me in a toast, over a pint of Boundary Bay's Imperial Oatmeal Stout: To the liberation of all men from the Sirens-in-drag of modern advertising!

4305651,male,Student,"   although i will probably denounce everything written here within a few days - will see how the immovable posting sits there on my screen and betrays me - i think i'll be posting here frequently. what is beautiful about drafts is that they are never finished, always boiling just below the skin, but never your skin. never you. i love going through old drafts. most remain as drafts, and are always there to give you a fresh point of departure. there's a certain amount of power in that, at least for a profession such as this, where powerlessness is nearly all of the time and contemplation the only respite.  you see the thing is is that i stole my roommate maya aravind's chair while she's away for the week, so i have an excuse to be typing here as much as possible. the arm rests are a perfect height. plain pine, but they curve inward slightly. with my elbows propped upon them, my fingers meet about an inch below the chin, and to do any contemplating i really have to hunch. rodin's statue is precise because with the chin rested firmly at the end of a hunch, on some knuckles, one's thoughts sink right down into the mouth.   at Nussbaum & Wu this afternoon, Broadway and 113, i saw a hungry baby offered a french fry by his mother from off of the father’s plate.  instead of letting the baby bite off the piece of fry slipped into her mouth, the mother pulls it back at the last second.  the baby gets only the oily and salty taste from off the air-cooled fry.  like any creature of common sense, the child extends her hand toward the father’s plate, beyond the mother entirely, toward that universally tantalizing taste.  broadway and 113 is as good a place as any in New York to watch, for brief moments and in teased out performances, beautiful women. in any other city the pace of life would slow us all to a parade lingering too long on the eye. this is uncomfortable for the voyeur at any other pace.  the voyeur would begin to isolate the intricate flaws of the women walking by. i suppose an argument can be made that a voyeur perceives slower in other cities, and that the speed of the women walking is relative to his skill for ignoring the obvious and celebrating the ideal. i suppose an argument could be made that New York has the most beautiful women and the best admirers of them. i would personally find it a difficult point to argue. if anything, they certainly walk faster here than anywhere else women have some place to go. where exactly they're going, i have no idea. it ain't toward me.

2821801,female,indUnk,"            Firstly, let me say that Michael Moore is a waste of oxygen who needs to have his breathing-privileges permanently fuckin' revoked for constantly churning-out 4-plus-hour pieces of self-indulgent garbage and allowing hoardes of mindless bastards with room-temperature IQs to call him 'visionary' and 'gifted' and all the other fuckin' mindless platitudes they reserve for only the most TALENTLESS cunts in the Director-game nowadays!   Michael Moore suffers from a sadly non-fatal disease called A.N.T.S (Absolutely No Talent Syndrome) and watching his movies is less stimulating than intravenous valium and almost as unpleasant as watching naked 70-year-old homosexuals fuck.  That having been said, it would be a good idea if his next movie was entitled 'The decapitation and disembowelment of Michael Moore: Death Of A Talentless Cunt Thanks to Mango for bringin this to my attention!!

Of course, I will have none of that as I am literally packing up the bass to get started on the new round of Hypefactor songs. Should be fun and interesting.  Chemlab update: First from Chicago: Vocals are done and the album is officially in the mixing stage now. I think Mr. Duffy has gotten his hands on a few of the tunes so you KNOW good things are happening. From NY: I spent a few hours at Brandt's studio yesterday going through a cassette tape that Jared gave to me containing two full sides of old Chemlab demos from their East Side Sessions. There is so much incredible stuff on this mother. I immediately wrote Jared a threatening letter that we eventually had to go back to some of the songs that never saw the light cause there is a ton of good ideas on this that were never completed. Man, gimme some of the drugs they were on back then making this awesome music!  As usual, I have gone out and bought far too many discs lately. Everything from new Ogre (really good), Hate Dept (snooze), Type O Negative (a good return to form). But nothing and i mean NOTHING beats the long awaited live album from Primal Scream, called 'Live in Japan'. This Japanese only release is without a doubt one of the best live albums I have ever heard and I can't stop listening to it. if you are even remotely a fan, this is worth seeking out. As a hardcore fan of this band, I am blown away. I saw them earlier this year and loved it, but this disc surpasses that by a million times. It's one of those rare albums that makes you wanna go and be in a band. Incredible.  In other incredible news, the GENIUS that is Gustavo Cerati is doing a rare tour of the United States this month. To say there are happy faces in the MOGcamp would be an understatement. I'm seeing him in LA as well. DONT MISS HIM. What a trip to LA this is gonna be: the reunited Duran Duran, The San Diego Comic Con, Raw at Staples center (thanks AL), and Cerati, plus Brad Cramps bachelor party. oh yeah, I will work too ;-)  Have a good, safe holiday, kids.

589736,male,Technology,"           something else that hasn't been specifically addressed yet: 'disappearing' vs. 'leaving a corpse' at the death of a jedi.  in e4, obi-wan 'dies' at vader's saber, but leaves no body behind - an event which seems to puzzle vader.  in e6, yoda dies by visibly fading away in front of luke.  also in e6, vader dies, but his body remains.  same for qui-gon in e1, and some unknown jedi in e2 (in the arena scene).   so what's up with that?  you can't argue that only jedi masters get to fade away when they buy it - qui-gon was a master.  there's an argument to be made regarding whether a jedi has the time to anticipate his or her own death; yoda and obi-wan both knew it was immanent, and if there's some 'thing' one needs to do to not leave a body behind, perhaps it requires at least a few moments to prepare.  obi-wan turned off his saber and closed his eyes; yoda relaxed and closed his eyes.  some sort of meditative state is suggested by these moments.    qui-gon did medidate in the middle of his fight with darth maul, but he apparently felt optimistic enough about the outcome of the battle that he didn't bother to memorize the 'body fade away at death' spell.  ;)  however, he stayed alive long enough to have some final words with obi-wan - so why wasn't he able to utilize that period of time to initiate his 'disappearence'?  unless it requires that you prepare yourself   before   a fatal blow, this explanation isn't consistent.  and then there's vader/annakin.  supposedly, and by his own admission, luke 'saved' him from the dark side before he died.  he even appears as a 'ghost' next to obi-wan and yoda at the end of e6 - which suggests that all 3 of them went to the same 'place' after death.  so why does vader leave a body behind?  i've heard some fans argue that perhaps his body faded away 'off camera', and that luke was only burning vader's armor in the funeral pyre.  i don't buy this, though.    heck, maybe the 'disappearing death' is some new trick that the jedi learn between e2 and e4!  after all, sometime during this same period, the whole branch of thought concerning 'midichlorians' gets dumped...  thoughts?  i know this is an obscure one, and it may come down to an inconsistency that in hindsight, lucas said, 'oh crap, that's right.  oh well.'

There was this guy named johnreed. johnreed he was a character. hE WAS walking outside at 4:30 in the morning on MARION ave. which is a never-ending road! Well he was walking along the road when all of a sudden a guy in a pink and blue tractor-trailer pulled up beside him and blew a dart of poison into this neck. The man got out of his car and pulled john into the car and took him home. JOhn woke up 13 hours later with a horrible headache. The first thing he saw was the figure of a man wearing a purple suit.” who are you', john still dizzy asked. 'My name,MR. Rxxd, is Sam Kingostopper'. 'But U can call me Kingo, all my closest friends doo'!.John says, now getting jumpy, 'What am doing here'!!!!!! 'This has to be some shorta joke!' 'Where am I'? KINGO replys,'u are in the ghetto.' 'There are no ghettos'!,  JOHN REPLYS. 'That is a ignorant thing to say fool”, said KINGO. 'Stop playin word games with meee!'Says john. 'IM NOT PLAYIN WORD GAMES WITH YOU'. All of a sudden kingo forces john to lick a poisoness frog. john passes out and hits the floor.Kingo goes back to playing with his pet lobster, named bunny. john wakes up a day later, remmbering what had happened.O CRAPz!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'MR. jOHNrEEd u have finally woken up, u had a very long and pleasent nappy-sleppy-sleppy.' john said,' cut to the case, why am i here.' 'its very simple,mr.reed, i kiddnapped you becasue i need your help',kingo says. 'Ok, I will help u just stopp druggin me, it isnt very nice', john reply. 'Alright, just stopp yellin and caring on like a crazy hamster under shock hearpy', relpys kingo. JOHn takes a deep breath and leans back in the chair. 'Ok lay it on me!' Kingo stepps back and sits down on the sofa,'ok i need u to brush Bunny's teeth'. 'WHAT??????', JOHN REPLYS. 'Who is Bunny and why do u wANt me to do that.'  Kingo looks a john and picks up bunny, 'bUNNY is the name of my losbter'.. 'oh ok phyco', repleys john. 'ok stop makin fun of me mr.reed, do u wanna lick the frog again??', replys kingo. 'O no, anything but that, i just dont understand, why cant u do it ur self?? 'very go qwestion, i have a allergy toward toothpaste, kingo says while crying. 'Stop that u look like a pansy',tells john reed. 'please mr.johnreed, (looks and hugs the lobster)bunny doesnt want to get a cavity, do u bunny??!!'. 'fine, after this will u let me go home, i have to watch the si-fi channel, there is a show without guns on tonighT', replys john. 'fair enough, or u could live there!', said kingo getting mighty excited,(jumping up and down like a little girl) ' we can sing NICK NACK PATTY WACK all day long.!!' NO no just let me do this and then take me home', john replys with wide eyes . KIngo hands the lobster to john and a small toothbrush just big enough for a lobster. it only take john about 5mins to brush the lobsters discolored teeth. 'done',says john. 'great job mr.johnreed', says kingo full of gratitude. 'I will take u home know but i must  drug u one more time. i dont want anyone finding out where i live!', kingo says while looking thorugh some boxes. all of a sudden the man takes out a vial of blue liquid, and shouts,'fair larwence lives on 4ever!!!' john looks up in dissbelief,'I will drink it, it is the only way to get away from this crazy insane man!!' john falls to the ground.  · 3 hours later john wakes up in the driveway of this home, dizzy. His dad is standing over him. Myron says,'i told u no drugs jon, this is very dissapointing.' .'but dad i didnt do drugs, i was kiddnapped.' 'i dont believe u, why would soemone kiddnapp u, thats why you are taking kun fu, so u dont get taken by anyone.' john stammers out,' but itys not kun fu'!! 'no i dont care what it is , get up stairs u are grounded for the next 3 weeks, and u are going to get spanked  100 times with a seat belt!!' 'great'. john returns to the kichen woundering weather he had dreamed the whole thing or if he really did meet the crazy man named kingo. 'o yeah by the why john,  meet the mayor of mansfield, he needs my help with  his job', says john dad, 'mr. kingostopper'. john turns white, kingos and johns eyes meet and john runs up to his room screaming and then gets into the fetal position and shakes.

4192173,male,Technology,"             Dropped into the studio last night. Had no agenda really, I thought originally we were going to have Robin and Ash in there, but both bailed.  Speaking of Ash, he handed in a rough draft of THEME FROM PROPAGANDA and I am quite happy with the results. I think it’s off to a really solid start and has achieved what I was hoping to have on this album, a good house track to serve as the centerpiece. Besides some minor mix notes as well as a few structure ideas, this track is well on its way. It was a perfect first track to listen to in my new Ipod (THANKS IRENE!)  Anyhow, got to the studio and Brandt unearthed a track we started last month in the initial sessions and then somehow was forgotten. It consisted of a drum loop, enough basslines for a verse and a chorus and my long lost piano that I thought I had done in the song EXIST. I had been ranting and raving for the first month of this album that I had done piano somewhere and it was lost. Needless to say, it was nice to be justified that I am not crazy and we now have our eighth song for HF2.  We re-recorded some of the bass that I wasn’t 100% on and then I threw down some sci-fi strings that Ash will hate. Brandt played some sweet guitars, and I tried to steer him toward a “less is more” approach to this song. the results were akin to David Gilmour meeting Richard Ashcroft. Atmosphere is the name of the game for this tune, which now has the working title of SOLAR.  We’re back in the studio tonight, hopefully joined by ash and possibly Young Oscar Hess aka The Kidd. He’ll be the first person outside of the core four to hear the work in progress. As evidenced by his work on FLOOD and THE DISTRACTED LOVER, the Kidd is the person you want to have come in and give you a fresh perspective  on the material. Besides being my alleged younger sibiling, he is the only man I know besides me who has seen Marisa Tomei’s boobs in person. It’s a unique bond to share. I hope he makes it.  Had a long catch up session with original MOG member and former aggressioner Chris Link, who is impressed I have several of his F-11 songs in my Ipod. Link is a talented musician who I learned tons from in my formative years. Also, he got me into stuff like John Cale, Lou Reed and other cool stuff when we were young at NYU and I am forever in his debt (though I got him into Nick Cave!). I have invited Link to get in on HF2 while we are still writing. I’ll see him in Chicago next week and we will discuss further.  Further to an entry below, after tons of Duran Duran fans crashed the ticketmaster server during the internet pre-sale, I got crazy lucky and was able to purchase tickets to see the Durans at Webster Hall on my birthday next week.

589736,male,Technology,"           One can only hope that the debunking from AICN towards the bottom of this posting is true.  My apologies in advance for the lengthy copy/paste.  From Dark Horizons:  ******  ...We've heard about Lucas yet again making changes to the original trilogy to update it. Til now most of the rumours have been about adding additional elements like more in regards to Alderaan before its destruction and so on. The gossip reached fever pitch earlier today over the Internet but now it seems the whole fiasco has been defused. Here's the story.  First up the rumours that emerged over at The Digital Bits yesterday:  'These changes include new special effects, revised and updated shots and scenes, and new footage shot with actors Hayden Christensen (Anakin) and Ian McDiarmid (the Emperor) that would flesh out moments with their characters in the original films. For example, an aged and scarred Hayden now appears as Anakin at the end of Return of the Jedi when Luke removes Vader's helmet.   Among the other changes reportedly being made are the restoration of the original 'Han shoots first' moment from Star Wars and a revamped lightsaber fight between Obi-Wan and Vader. What we've heard meshes with what we've been told before, which is that Lucas has always planned to release ultimate, 'Archive' editions of these films that tie in better with the new prequels.   The main question in our minds now is this: will these changes be completed in time to appear on the DVD releases planned for next September, or will we have to wait until after Episode III hits theaters to see them? And if we have to wait, what versions will appear on the DVDs? Time will tell'.  That wasn't the only site with talk of it. TheForce.Net posted an extensive list of all the apparent rumoured changes in order for the original trilogy - 22 for 'A New Hope', 10 for 'Empire' and 14 for 'Jedi'. Amongst musical cue differences and improved lightsaber and spaceship effects there's some big changes here:  'A New Hope' - A new scene which has been shot during the filming of Episode III in which the Emperor dissolves the Senate.  - The bleeding arm on the floor in the Cantina has been replaced with a non-bleeding arm because it's now canon that lightsabers cauterize wounds  - The original Han/Greedo shooting scene has been restored  - When the Death Star destroys Alderaan there's a new scene of Yoda's reaction to the disturbance in the Force that is created by all those deaths and then it cuts to Obi-Wan reacting to it as well  - Temuera Morrison's voice is being recorded for use with all the stormtroopers  - The Obi-Wan/Vader duel has been spruced up. It is much more epic and there is much more movement. A modified version of Duel of the Fates is being considered for the scene  - There's a new scene (shot during Episode III) where Darth Vader goes to Coruscant and lands his ship in the same building Count Dooku does at the end of Attack of the Clones. Except now the building is all fixed up and it is now Palpatine's palace. He meets with Palpatine to ask for forgiveness for his failure and inform him of a new potential who is strong in the Force  'Empire Strikes Back' - Tom-Toms are now CG, the Hoth battle is much more extensive.  - Temuera Morrison's voice is being recorded for the older Boba Fett and all the stormtroopers  - Ian McDiarmid has refilmed scenes as the Emperor. The conversations between Vader and Palpatine is now longer and features a few connections to the prequels  - Yoda's face is now animated in CG allowing more expression of emotions yet his movements remain the same. Also two deleted scenes featuring Yoda instructing Luke have been restored  - A new scene was shot in which the stormtroopers, after they capture Han, Leia and Chewie, bring Vader the box containing C-3PO in pieces. Vader orders the stormtroopers to bring the broken droid to Chewbacca's cell so that he can fix him  'Return of the Jedi' - Jabba, Yoda & the Ewoks are now mostly CG.   - In the battle of Endor there are thousands of Ewoks and they are more vicious than there midgets-in-suits counterparts. More bite the dust now.  - Palpatine's face has gotten a CG lift, the black blotches removed  - Sebastion Shaw who played Anakin when he was unmasked has been replaced with Hayden Christenson in make-up to make him look older. Anakin has much more dialogue. He apologizes for the destruction he caused, he thanks his son for turning him back to the light, he tells his son to rebuild the Jedi and he says he loves him and his sister. Just before he dies he says, 'It is finished...'.  - We see more planets celebrating at the end of the movie. We see an aged Jar Jar, who is now the leader of the Gungans, on Naboo celebrating with the people of Naboo and the Gungans. We see an old Watto, who is now unable to fly, sitting in a hover chair cheering on Tatooine. During these scenes Across the Stars plays transitioning to the victory celebration music at the Ewok tree village.  - Anakin's spirit is now played by Hayden Christenson with make-up to make him look his age. He looks on proudly at his son Luke with the spirit of Padme by his side  The full list can be found here, there's also talk that 'Episode I' will also get a revamp of some sort.  Just a few hours ago though, another site has weighed in - none other than AICN who calls the whole thing an utter fabrication. Here's ' Moriarty':  'I'm going to have to call this one out as being total nonsense. This exact word for word list ran as a talkback by a guy named 'Donnie Darko' several weeks ago, and that's not the first time I've seen it show up. Yes, Lucas is working on Archival Editions of the films, despite his continued denial of it in public, like at a UCLA appearance this week. Yes, there are some dramatic things they're trying. But this fanboy wish list is just not true. And the films that are coming out on DVD next fall are the Special Editions you've seen already. The ones released in '97. No changes.

766556,female,indUnk,"         urlLink Top Ten Driving Tips for Miami    1.  Lane dividing lines and crosswalk markings are only suggestions and do not require to be followed explicitly.  Basically, no one pays any attention to these.  2.  Turning signals also fall under the category as Tip #1.  Either they don't get used at all, or the left signal will remain blinking for the next 20 miles.  As indicated above, basically, no one pays any attention to these.  3.  Yellow means 'Get your ass through the intersection as quickly as possible.'  4.  Red means 'Get your ass through the intersection as quickly as possible before on-coming traffic gets there.'  5.  Green sometimes means, 'Let's wait and see what color comes next!'  6.  One way streets invariably will have some jerk driving down them the other way, while blaring his horn and blaming you for paying attention to the street signs and dividing lines. *See tip #1*  7.  While travelling south in the far right lane, the car ahead of you suddenly decides to make a left U-turn (no signal required), across two lanes of southbound traffic. Then, defying on-coming northbound traffic, the driver travels across those 'suggested' lane dividers to the farthest northbound lane.  What should you do as he arbitrarily travels across 4 lanes of moving traffic?   Answer:  Nothing.   Just keep driving; slight amazement at this everyday act is allowed, but not required.  8.  Never expect anyone to ever stop at a stop sign or to yield the right of way.  Ever.  9.  When driving late at night, all rules are off.  Traffic lights are often shut down after 10pm (especially in my neighborhood) to promote 'safety' in the streets.  Generally, this means that red, yellow and green all mean the same thing: 'Get your ass through the intersection as quickly as possible.' *Note: this tip is only slightly different from our previous tip on red lights.  This is because there is generally not any on-coming traffic in the 'hood at 10pm.  The occasional slow-moving pimp-mobile or cop car, but not much else.*  10. When the bum on the corner offers to clean your windshield for a dollar, save him the effort and just give him the dollar.  You have NO IDEA what could be in that bottle of liquid, and you probably don't want it on your car!  Diva out.           "

883178,male,Fashion,"            Stoners Review of Omnifest.    My sweetie and I have officially gone to half of the movies at this years Omnifest at the Science Museum. (I feel so cultured.) Weve seen Adrenaline Rush: The Science of Risk, Ocean Men: Extreme Dive, and The Great Barrier Reef. I was most excited for the last one  but unfortunately, I think it was filmed in the late seventies/early eighties. People actually laughed out loud. The narrators voice was very familiar  I remember it well from documentaries in eighth-grade science class. And it was extremely dramatic. Throughout, there were interviews with a couple who looove the ocean, and call the Great Barrier Reef their second home. Theyre very concerned about the damage that humans are doing (as they pull themselves along on the coral and step on it) and have befriended many fish (which they pet  these are fish  they have no fur). My sweetie and I agreed, most of the aquatic life around them looked terrified. My favorite quote of the movie came when the woman (who looks and sounds just like Olivia Newton-John) picked up a sleeping fish. As it started to wake up and freak out, she shoved it back into its sponge-y hiding place. In this very surreal, sweet voice she said see  you can pick up the fish and they hardly notice. This one is starting to stir a bit. Perhaps when it wakes up, it will think this was all just some horrible nightmare. (Insert sweet, Glinda-the-good-witch smile here.) Yes, she must really love those fish.  Whoa. That was quite the long post. Im impressed with myself.   Must...rest...now...          "

3359005,male,Student,"             If you ever see a random title, it's my opinions of the teams on each leg of the race. And it's starting to take form; the first one was Skrewts, a creature from Harry Potter. Now it's weasel. So if you just understood whatever the hell I just said, cheers for you. Here's the stuff!  Chip & Kim – The number one placing is very much undeserved. They have shown before that they are incapable of making flight arrangements. This week, they got lucky because Colin went all out to help everyone but Mirna. The thing is, you can’t depend on someone every leg, and you won’t be number one on the finishing line just because you can eat caviar.  Colin & Christie – I think they are one of the most strategic players to ever be in this game. They, along with Brandon & Nicole, see Charla & Mirna as threats and decided it would be best to try and bring them down. I really don’t like Colin’s dirty play, but it’s a really smart strategic move to try and get Charla & Mirna out early. Really, really bad choice getting a girl to eat when there’s a guy in the team. Guys are always stronger at these eating things… Just look at Fear Factor! Christie’s emerging as really bitchy. I know you’re all frustrated at having to eat salt, but no need to take it out on your boyfriend and another team!  Marshall & Lance – Same thing as Chip & Kim. These two got lucky with Colin playing dirty. You’re just pawns in his game, so watch out. I thought the “Don’t talk to me!” comment at the bus station when Mirna tried to ask you a question was really uncalled for. I mean, Mirna was actually trying to be nice and you told her to shut her trap. As the only other guy to have eaten the caviar, you really let your team down by doing it so much slower than Chip. I love it when you declared to everyone when they asked whether placings were still being respected, shows that you’re actually thinking of ways to get ahead. From then on, you just rode the “Colin help” wagon. According to the spoilers which have been accurate so far, these two go next week… Let’s continue hoping!  Charla & Mirna – Rock on gals! These two looked to be in huge trouble this time, but they managed to save themselves again. They have proved that they can survive independently, without any alliances and without any help from others. I really respect them for that, but a few friends won’t do any harm. Mirna is getting on my nerves, but I like Charla too much to make this team budge from my number one spot. As I said in my summary, I don’t know if they had secured on the connecting flight through Germany or just got lucky. If they indeed secured the Germany connecting flight, they’re the flight supremos this season. The editors very unhelpfully forgot to tell us when the Swiss Air flight would arrive compared to Colin & Christie’s flight. The editors might be trying to downplay them, lest they stick out as the winners this season because of their superior flight arranging skills.  Brandon & Nicole – I hate their strategy so badly, and it doesn’t seem to work. They make alliances that they know they will not keep, and benefit without benefiting others. I also hate the way that they keep proclaiming to be Christians. Christie said something to the effect of them being Christian, but they will be ruthless when it comes to competition. Something about playing well. It’s like saying “I’m Christian, but I will not hesitate to lie, cheat and steal…” What a hypocrite! Brandon, they one doing all the lying to alliances, states that he wants to live as an example to others, so won’t drink the vodka. So your living example would be to backstab whenever necessary? Stop contradicting yourselves, and stop reminding us you’re Christian! The fact that we know you’re Christian, and yet see you backstab people week after week is enough!  Linda & Karen – Queerly, we didn’t see much of them this episode. Maybe they’re not as interesting as I initially thought they were. I actually thought they are the female versions of Ken & Gerard, but now it doesn’t seem so much like it. They don’t have much skills in finding flights. I mean, Charla & Mirna jumped right to the front again with their skills, but you couldn’t? You’re losing your entertainment value in this season, and you’re not a very proficient team at the race. Your leaving would make more space for the more interesting teams to show!  Kami & Karli – Second to last, again? This teams physical capabilities has pulled them through so far, but their lack of brains will pull them down eventually. I really can’t say much about this team, cause they haven’t really been featured much. I admire the fact that they one doing the Roadblock was shivering when she was done. It was a much better reaction than giving up and sleeping like the other prom queens. Sheer grit and determination is what got her through. The comment about “We hate getting pushed back already” was a redundant statement. If you don’t like getting pushed back, do something about it…  Bob & Joyce – Awww… Last week I said that I was beginning to see why my friend liked them so much., and this week they are eliminated. I did say that they weren’t showing much character and will need to go if they stay this boring, but I didn’t mean this soon! Joyce ate the caviar fast, and she can be counted as a prom queen cause she’s a skinny female. She didn’t even flinch! We didn’t exactly see Joyce finish the caviar, so I kind of think the producers were kind enough to tell her that they’d already been eliminated. Bob’s words to her on the horse carriage sounded as if she was on her deathbed traveling around the world… Err… I don’t think I should be so mean to such a loving couple.

3572471,male,Communications-Media,"   So I socialized today.&nbsp; And yesterday.&nbsp; I got a couple e-mails inviting me to interesting little grad student and young professional things—a foreign film screening and a networking event—so I got in my car and I drove there, like millions of people in L.A. do when a friend calls and tells them, hey, dude there’s a neat screening of this really twisted Russian film, or hey, co-worker I have an occasional beer with after work, guess what, I heard about this get-together among people who work their ass off 40-50 hours a week at the same type of job we have and let’s go commiserate and talk about how much we hate our bosses and the petulance of the well-to-do American executive and hey, we might even make a good friend.&nbsp; Imagine that. &nbsp;A good friend.&nbsp; A new friend.  &nbsp;  I get to the foreign film screening and no one is in the theater.&nbsp; Great, I think.&nbsp; Drove up here for nothing.&nbsp; Wasted all this gas.&nbsp; So glad I decided to socialize.&nbsp; Then I walk outside and see the grad students, playing a sun-splashed game of croquet on the University quad.&nbsp; They’re all tan and sweaty and red-faced on this dry-hot day, because dry-hot is the only way they can get hot and sweaty playing croquet.&nbsp; They’re also chasing each other around, playing flirtatious games with the croquet mallot.&nbsp; My good friend in the Dodger hat slides the nub in the performance artist girl’s butt-cleavage.&nbsp; Hysterical laughter ensues, and the faces get redder and everyone’s having a great time and let’s reach in the big red cooler and get another beer and isn’t it gosh-darn lovely to be 25 and still have care-free summers?&nbsp; And who the hell is this guy in the chinos and discount Kohl’s dress shirt?&nbsp;  &nbsp;  “Dude, aren’t you hot?” offers my Dodger fan friend, barely recognizable, having grown a pillowy tuft of hair since I last saw him three months ago.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I grin sheepishly, nodding at the crooked wickets.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  “Looks like something you do in the summer.”&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Nobody gets my ironic attempt at humor.&nbsp; Yeah, dipshit, they all think, it does look like something you do in the summer.&nbsp; That’s why we’re doing it.&nbsp; Go back to your cubicle.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The foreign film is indulgent, like the moderator said it would be, and afterward everyone pairs off into the summer romances that have blossomed, and everyone asks me when I’m graduating.&nbsp; Like they can’t wait to get rid of me.&nbsp; Like they never had me.&nbsp; But then, how could they have ever had me?&nbsp; I sit behind a desk all day.&nbsp; I was lucky to make it to this screening on time at 7 p.m.&nbsp; They run in the park and wallow in the shade of California green tall spiky trees and feed each other grapes and wine and Miller Lite.&nbsp; They enjoy life.&nbsp; And I can’t be their friends.&nbsp; Not unless they’ll carry a Blackberry around and check it regularly for the latest off-color e-mail forward, anyway.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  So I socialized and had a crappy time and felt like a dad showing up early to pick his 13-year-old son from a testosterone-drenched sleep-over, one with Playboys and Ultimate Fighting and Hustlers and Bench Press Contests and Barely Legals. I was a stuffed-shirt spoiler.&nbsp; Maybe I needed to hang out with my element: work-a-holic twenty-somethings.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  So the next evening I get in my good-times-mobile and head north again.&nbsp; I feel like a mouse in a maze trying to park in the cramped little beach town, but I finally slide into a curbside without red markings.&nbsp; On the way to the meeting place, I break a twenty at a dive bar and pound a Red Stripe, at once an attempt to avoid awkwardness in a group pay-for-the-check situation and an attempt to get a little buzz going before meeting a bunch of strangers.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  But from the moment I shake Heidi’s hand, I know letting beer slip through my lips was akin to chugging a 40-ouncer before a basketball game.&nbsp; Networking is an endurance event, a discipline worth mastering.&nbsp; Drinking will throw you from your game.&nbsp; Heidi would know.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  “I’ve been networking and networking and networking,” Heidi says.&nbsp; “You have to do it so hard-core.&nbsp; And here in L.A? &nbsp;Please.&nbsp; It’s all about who you know.&nbsp; It’s never merit.&nbsp; And believe me, I have merit.&nbsp; Hello?&nbsp; Berkeley grad.&nbsp; Hello?&nbsp; Held a mid-management slot in San Francisco.&nbsp; And these people are trying to look at me for entry-level work?&nbsp; Are they kidding me?”  &nbsp;  Nobody else is any different, except a lovely undersized couple from a head-hunting firm literally trying to sell me.&nbsp; Everyone gripes about their current job and about how their tenacious networking has yet to pay off.&nbsp; My networking has yet to advance beyond hooking my DSL line up to the hub, so I guess I’m in trouble.&nbsp; I wanted to have a few laughs, pick up some job leads, maybe, find a way out of my current hell-in-a-cubicle.&nbsp; All I got was a sales pitch and a twenty-minute sermon on forging connections and collecting as many business cards as you can from a girl who apparently didn’t deem me worthy, because she left without requesting a business card.&nbsp; And then there was the girl I remembered from the last networking event I went to a year ago, who didn’t remember me and seemed freaked out when I greeted her by name.&nbsp; Then she politely told me to take a hike, “Go talk to Larry and Davida….they can help you find a better job.”&nbsp; In other words, go walk into a sales pitch.&nbsp; You’re scaring me.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  So after two days of flaunting my formidable social graces, it’s time for a consolation prize: a 40 of Mickey’s.&nbsp; I pull into the Liquor store near home.&nbsp; It’s an easy summer night and the tall, lean Armenian attendant I know too well stands outside.&nbsp; Must be slow in there.&nbsp; I feel a little uneasy walking past him, making him go back to work, becoming the only man in an empty temple of booze.&nbsp; But soon I have company.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  “Hey-ah, Dood, whasssup?”  &nbsp;  It’s a stumbling drunk in a blue hockey jersey.&nbsp; He’s heading for the same cooler I am.&nbsp; I grab my Mickey’s, expecting to hear a “Good call, dude,” but instead:  &nbsp;  “Ah, it’s Sarmuch, boy.&nbsp; Sarmush, how ya doin’?&nbsp; Back here now, huh?”  &nbsp;  Sarmuch the Armenian attendant nods politely, then walks towards the register to check me out.  &nbsp;  “They usually got you over on 4th and Ximeno now, huh?” hockey guy bellows, loud enough to crack a mini-bottle.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I don’t care how Sarmuch responds.&nbsp; I am in the liquor store, joining a man, who so frequents the local liquor stores he notices when folks shift from site to site, in buying a 40-ouncer.&nbsp; Maybe  he’s  my kind of guy.&nbsp;   "

Although that particular existence would be quite fruitless,we might then feel secure. Maybe then, people like me would have a  right  to complain about the injustice of it all, as opposed to now, when we do,regardless of whether we have license to, or not. Yet,when you really contemplate it, would we  really  feel any more secure? Knowing you are being hurried down a blind past, knowing nothing of how it may end. Unsure of whether anything you accomplished,attempted, or felt passionate about would mean anything in your inevitable end. Can living ever be simple?

589736,male,Technology,"           MISSION TO MARS FOR MILITARY BENEFIT, NOT JUST 'SPIRIT OF DISCOVERY'  President Bush unveiled his proposal for a new space program Wednesday by invoking the spirit of explorers Lewis and Clark, saying, 'They made that journey in the spirit of discovery... America has ventured forth into space for the same reasons.'   But the president didn't mention that members of his administration view space as the next frontier for military buildup and conquest.  Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld chaired the Commission to Assess United States National Security Space Management and Organization four years ago, releasing its findings in January 2001. Rumsfeld's report found that 'we know from history that every medium -- air, land and sea -- has seen conflict. Reality indicates that space will be no different.'  The panel also concluded that 'given this virtual certainty, the [United States] must develop the means both to deter and to defend against hostile acts in and from space.'  The president's focus on space exploration because it 'improves our lives, and lifts our national spirit.' However, behind the scenes, USA Today reported that Bush was persuaded to move forward in part due to the military benefits, as promoted to him by Vice President Cheney.   The Center for American Progress' Progress Report yesterday noted an appearance by Republican Congressman Tom Feeney on Scarborough Country where he stated, 'Somebody is going to dominate space.  When they do, just like when the British dominated the naval part of our globe, established their empire, just like the United States has dominated the air superiority, ultimately, whoever is able to dominate space will be able to control the destiny of the entire Earth.'  Feeney's comments echo PNAC's September 2000 report Rebuilding America's Defenses, which said, 'Much as control of the high seas - and the protection of international commerce defined global power in the past, so will control of the new 'international commons' be a key to world power in the future.'    urlLink -Bush Aims for Mars to Dominate Space Militarily          "

4192173,male,Technology,"             So, Irene and I made the trek to a midtown Manhattan movie theatre to see a special preview of HELLBOY, the large motion picture based on the Dark Horse Comic. Believe this or not kids, I have never one in my life read a copy of this comic. Therefore, I was going into it fresh, with nothing to compare it to. Needless to say, I was impressed, especially with the first half of the movie. The set-up is great and the actors are super, especially Ron Pearlman as the title character. To be able to create a sympathetic and likeable character with all the make-up and gear on really blew me away. I love the character, I love the set up, and it’s obvious that the director loves this comic more than anyone. It’s exceptionally well-directed and the FX are top notch. However, the third act seems rather anti-climatic, similar to how I felt about SPIDERMAN, but I like these characters and are invested in them and want them to win at the end. That takes a lot these days, but it just needed that one kick ass moment at the end to put it over for me. So, in retrospect, HELLBOY gets a big thumbs up and I hope to follow more of his adventures.  CLONE WARS Season Two and while I loved it, especially since it’s starting to lead to the schism between Obi-Wan and Anakin, I loved it even more watching the first 10 episodes in a row with 5 Year Old Cousin who could be my Clone. This led to much playtime and web searching for Birthday presents for him. I think he will be quite happy with his Republic Gunship.  Thanks to one of the web savvy rivet kids (this time, its Aero), I just heard 5 tracks off of the new Skinny Puppy album THE GREATER WRONG OF THE RIGHT. Well, I’m happy to report it’s really super stuff. It takes the best of it’s two main principals, Ogre and Key and plays to each of their incredible strengths. The production is incredible and Ogre’s vocals are amazing. It’s actually similar to his solo material. When he works with Mark Walk, he’s usually either very straightforward in his delivery or Walk goes Pro Tools crazy on him. This works on the solo stuff, but no one knows how to get the best out of Ogre than Cevin Key. While I feel there are elements and sounds that go back to the old Puppy days, I feel this is very contemporary. It reminds me of RABIES era done in a modern style with better programming. It’s a big step forward from THE PROCESS, which remains one of the most underrated albums ever released. Yes this has guitars, but not in the way THE PROCESS had them. A great comeback and I’ve only heard 5 songs!  If Watts, Ministry, NIN and Die Warzau can live up to the Puppy album, The I-Rock old guard is gonna clean house this year. Now where are the kids!? Who’s next! Come on.  F          "

After greetings were passed, one promptly asked me, and I paraphrase, 'Do you think you are going to Heaven when you die?'.  My response was a prompt but polite 'No.'.  They appeared shocked and asked me why.  I said that you can't go someplace that doesn't exist.  I explained that I am an atheist, and I believe that 'there is no god, or satan, or heaven, hell'.  And their response was, 'but you have to have faith in that, right?'  She went on to say that when you sit in a chair, do you thoroughly inspect it first, or do you just go and sit down?  Meaning that you have to have faith that the chair will support you, and won't fall apart.  My question is this....Since when did religion trademark the word 'faith' as only pertaining to ones belief in a deity of some sort.  Why is it that if I have faith, then I must in some way or another believe in god?  No offense to the christians out there, but it really pissed me off.         "

Anyway I realised I'm not posting much about my regular life anymore, so since I'm free and not sleepy, I'll do that right now!  First let's start off with the tests. Quite a few tests back over the recent weeks, and I topped all of them! With a Bio and E Maths perfect, I'm invincible at the moment. At least since this week, that is... I had a E Maths test on Monday on a topic I haven't done with my tutor, and I know that I did really horribly. Then yesterday came the big blow, my English test came back and I crapped. I actually failed an English test. At one point in time I remembered being regarded as an English expert. And I failed my test, 21/50. Entirely depressing! I guess it put me in place, so now I've got to work even harder... I'm really starting to wonder how long more I can keep this up. I have a feeling I'm going to break soon.  Anyway for Biology that idiotic b!tch Kelvin Chen got 24/25. He's really scary, cause now he's pumped to try and knock me off my top spot. I hoped he got really discouraged by my beating him when I didn't even study the night before. I'm wondering how I can convey that to him. 'You're stupid... I didn't even need to study to get this one, and you worked so hard for a less than perfect score.' Any suggestions on how that message can get to him?  I went out with Mum and Dad today, and if I remember correctly I ate Shanghainese. My memory is horrible these days, need to think before I can remember what I ate a few hours ago. On the way there there was this old Caucasian man pushing his wife out of Gleneagles hospital. His wife seemed to be real sick and only had her ward robes on, and her flesh was poring out of it. I didn't mean to say she's fat, I just wanted to show how weak and helpless she looked. Anyway they seemed to be rushing to Tanglin Mall. I really don't know what was happening, but I kind of think she was pretty much ready to go, and her husband was granting her her last wish or something. It's scary to think that you might be in this position a couple of years down the road. That's probably one of the reasons why I don't want to get married.

Im like, what is your obsession with Sams Club? and my mother went on about how its near a Home Depot, and much more convenient than St. Louis Park.  Didnt answer my question, but I guess its a response.  I just dont understand why any two-person household needs to buy in bulk.  Its not like theyre caterers!  Anyway, today my dad brought it up AGAIN (!!!), and I said does mother know that Wal-Mart is not allowing their employees to unionize?  His response was silence, and then, your mother is not a liberal.  No, shes not.  But at least shes got an 18-month supply of corn flakes.         "

No, he said, nothing happened to my books. There they are, up on the shelf where they've always been.'         "

He came up after Mass at school Friday and told me that the reflection I gave was one of the best he ever heard, and he said he wasn't lieing, even though I'm pretty sure he was.  ....and also on that note, that people are still stopping me in the halls to tell me they liked what I said Friday.  Five of my teachers STOPPED CLASS to tell me they thought I did a good job, and random people I don't even know stop in the halls between classes.

Today wasn't bad considering it is my least favourite day. Something good happened for a change, which was good and has given me renewed confidence in myself.   It started yesterday though, when I got back an assignment I had worked hard on . The mark on the paper was 55. My tutor said she wanted to see me and said that it was one of the best reports she had read, and that it was well written and argued.   I thought to myself, 'am i hearing this right?'.. and told her I wasn't happy and that I wanted something to happen. I asked her if i could re do the assignment and she said she;d ask ...   so needless to say I was pretty fired up yesterday afternoon. ...  whilst on this fired up trippy thing i wrote email to the lecturer and course coordinator requesting to see him to talk about it..  long story short I went today and got him to read it and it was remarked too.. got 70!!!  I almost fell off my seat!!   The moral of the story is that if you know yourself, then no one can tell you otherwise. I knew I was capable of more than a 55  - I usually get average marks like 70 and in this case I knew it was worth about that...   Hehehe... what a day!   ;P         "

3928610,male,indUnk,"        In the race for NL Central Supremacy the Cardinals are flexing their muscles with a 10 game lead over the second place Cubs. Whoever, finishes second could have a legitimate shot at the Wild Card, but not if the West keeps up the press they have had for first place. However, let's not forget that Atlanta and Philadelphia are no slouches in the East. Whether they make the cut or not, one thing is sure for the Cubs in the second half of the season; now that the Cubs DL is almost empty they still have an enormous uphill battle for second place and a Mt. Everest climb for a sure shot at a playoff birth. Which brings me to my true point...Kenny's $20 bet is as good as toast.    "

2844168,female,Marketing,"                 Today was a long and tiring day! We started out early and helped some friends move into their new house. It was a beautiful day for their move, and not even the drizzle later in the day could dampen their excitement to get into their newly built house. I have to say, I did pretty good about not coveting. Ever since we moved here I've wanted our own house so badly. I'm starting to get the itch to nest and I can't wait to be able to paint and decorate our own place. God's been working on me about not coveting since it seems like everyone else we know has their own house. We've helped so many people move into and paint their houses. It's been a big issue for me and many times I feel like we'll never own our own place. It just seems impossible. I have to keep giving it up to God over and over again. So I can honestly say I am excited for our friends and their new house, and when those twinges of jealousy started to creep up, I stomped them out and ignored them.  After we left their place we drove to a car dealership to look at some cars. It's still frustrating, and we're not excited to be looking for a car. We're thankful that our current one is still running and we're praying it will continue to do so until we find another one. We kind of walk around the lot despondently looking at the cars. We found one that might work yesterday, but it's a little out of our price range. So we keep looking. We came home just exhausted and watched some mindless tv before heading to bed. Whenever a car commercial came on I made Ked change the channel. I'm tired of looking at cars and trying to be lured into something nice that we can't afford! I think I have to agree with one of our friends who recently was having car trouble with BOTH his cars - cars are from the devil!!               "

Half way thru dinner, I tried to switch on the TV to watch the Chingay Procession 'live' but can't get it. I was asking them 'Hey, Chingay what time huh?'  Then, Uncle Tom and Auntie Rose started to look at their watches to tell me the current time.   One old friend shouted 'Oi, you asking your 'chingay' what is the time or you asking 'what time will be chingay be on?'   Then I realise Egene's parents thought I was calling to them as 'ching-gay' in Hokkien, which means 'in-laws'.  hahahah so funny...... Luv, MUm'   All I can say is, OH... MY... GAWD.....          "

883178,male,Fashion,"            Reminiscing or Rage Against the Dying of the Light or Nothing Gold Can Stay or Where the Fuck is Stoner  By Duf Fer  One time, me and Stoner walked around Uptown (coffee at Dunn Brothers, brunch at Figlio (her the omelette with cured proscuitto and brie, Duf a Bloody Mary and two eggs scrambled with Rosemary potatoes on the side), tried to get tickets for a matinee, but it was sold out, brother  never let it be said that the Twin Cities dont appreciate Almodovar!  Anyway). We talked about renting a canoe, but ended up getting Rollerblades at one of the local skate shops and doing a couple of laps around Calhoun.  It was a perfect day except at one point either my feet or her feet started hurting so we stopped skating for a moment and just chilled.  The way people just chill sometimes when chillin is all you need. After a healing moment or two, Stoner and I sat at Calhouns edge and hung our toesies in her pristine tides. It was one of those nights where initially the water was cold, but then, as you adjusted to it, it seemed perfect, you couldnt have imagined it any other way.  As the sun set, casting a perfect orange hue over the majestic lake, we commented on the restorative power of the water, downtown reflected on its stillness, the sun in harmony with its body, with us.  We skipped stones and traded stories.  I think we even talked about our dreams. We both conjured a day when we could meet on the World Wide Web as part of a larger community and expound on the mundane and trivial; we felt questions and answers should be a part of it so someone might ask:   what do you think happened to Stoner?    And the members of the community would all answer.   I confess, it was more her dream than mine, but man, what a great night.  Eventually, the absented sun left behind a sky studded with stars.  We saw one in particular  so bright it didnt seem real.  Its presence made that night, the kind of night when friendships are cemented, even more awesome.  Anyway, looking back on it all now that Stoner has left the land, Im only thankful that I got a chance to know herto really, really know her.  Reminiscing on that night and thinking about Stoner, I wonder if some stars just shine too brightly and then, fade too soon.  Sometimes I wonder if Stoner was that star.  Other times, I wonder if Pandyland is the star and Stoner was the sun.  Then, I wonder if Pandyland is the lake upon which all these images are reflected, and Stoner is downtown with clouds in the way so we cant see her.  Then I realize it doesnt figure that Ill know everything that day meantI just miss her, man.  Im not going to cry or anything  I shed my last tear over it this weekend, when I logged in for the 33rd time and still there was nothing.  I just think that if she is under a rock with no knife to cut her arm off with, and it is taking her a really long time to post because of having to type with one hand and fight off pain and passing out and stuff, then, wellat least we had that one night, you know?

883178,male,Fashion,"            eBay Scare   I like to mix it up, especially when I'm bored at work.  So I was talking with my coworker and we thought it would be a great idea to have a ping-pong table here at work in our corner office.  I said 'That's easy - we'll check 'em out on eBay!'  That was a mistake.  We went on eBay and looked up ping-pong tables.  A slightly used one popped up on the screen for less than $100.  For shits and giggles, I bid.  I was immediately overbid, which made it obvious that someone was Proxy Bidding - I assumed they put a maximum bid in for $100, so the site automatically puts in another bid for them when someone else bids.  So I put in another bid.  And won - I was now the top bidder.  Which immediately made me panic.  Two seconds later, though, someone put in a higher bid.  Relief!  But wait....5 minutes later?  They retracted their bid.   I was on top again.   Our first reaction: 'Fuck.'  Initial concern: how in the hell would we ship it here (the seller required the buyer to pay for shipping).  More important concern: if our NY office would find out we had a ping-pong table, we'd be fired for sure (but I suppose I can think of worse ways to get let go...).  So I performed an eBay no-no.  I retracted my bid, with the consequence of now having a negative record on eBay for the next 6 months.  Oh well.  It would have been pretty cool to have 'Ping-Pong Tournament Fridays' though.  That would mix well with our Friday Beer Run.  Who woulda thunk eBay could almost give you a heart attack?         "

2844168,female,Marketing,"                 Friday night we went to our first class for the Public Access TV station.Well, actually it was an orientation. We thought last week was orientation, but apparently that was pre-orientation! We're still not sure what we'll do for a t.v. program, but we're praying about it and starting to toss some ideas around in our heads. It really struck me when the instructor told us that we had a possible audience of 500,000. There's a lot of weight and responsibility there. Ked and I had prayed that we would move to a community that needed some of the Light and that we would be able to impact the community for Christ. We're definitely in an area in desperate need of Light and well, this just could be a medium to do some good with! The station is on the local basic cable on channels 19 and 20, which is awesome to be in the lower numbers - there's a better chance more people will stop on your program. The next class isn't until early May and that will be t.v. graphics. Ked is really excited about that one, naturally. In the meantime we've signed up to help with the Community Desk which means we can get hands on training while helping other producers with various community events such as parades, sports, religious events. We think it will be a great way to get involved in the community and get a feel for this public t.v. thing.  Tonight (Saturday) we went over to the Carrs in Winter Haven. Ked's Grandma and Grandpa have been visiting from Michigan and we made the 45 minute drive to hang out with them. We had a yummy KFC (which is Kitchen Fresh, not Kentucky Fried now!) dinner and a great time visiting with the fam. It's nice to have family close by! It's definitely made the transition easier for us.  One last bit of news. The site Ked did for his Uncle Ben is now live. Please, please, go visit  urlLink www.bencarrfamily.com  and tell other people about the site. Pray with us that this will be a tool God will use to generate prayer and financial support for this very special family. The site will give you Ben's story as well as ways that you can get involved including current prayer requests, a link to send a message of encouragement, and how to make a financial donation. Thank you!  Good night (or is it morning!!)               "

766556,female,indUnk,"        Diva is back  I've actually managed to get caught up on my workload here in the office.  *sssshh, don't tell my boss!* So, I can give you, my dearest reader, a little update on the weekend.  A friend from NY left the artic north for a little frolicking in the balmy Miami sunshine.  I am so glad when we can spend time together, he's the only other person I know who likes to just walk around and check things out. (Besides my brother, that is).  We strolled along Ocean Drive and Washington Ave, Lincoln Road and all across Downtown Miami - in just one afternoon!    Went to see The Last Samurai, and despite the vivid battle scenes - I hate blood, guts and violence - I really loved it.  It was so visually beautiful and so emotionally stirring.  Sometimes, the actors didn't have to say anything, the looks and actions expressed all that was intended.  And, as my friend pointed out, they didn't have Japanese villagers speaking English to each other.  They spoke Japanese, with English subtitles.  After all, why would they speak English to EACH OTHER?  It was well done, and I am really glad I got to see it.    OK, off my movie review soapbox.   As for the Holiday looming in the not-far-enough future, I say 'BAH HUMBUG!'  I have to fix my car's CV Joint and replace a rear tire - my third flat tire in less than 3 months - and I haven't  even started  my shopping.  Then there's all those holiday cards that are being received here at the hotel which just makes for more mail for me to open.  More work for me, delaying me from updating my blog.  And don't even get me started on the whole tree thing.  If I buy a real one *uh-oh.  I've started myself on this* If I buy a real tree, I'll have to haul the thing down to the dumpster in about 10 days, thereby wastefully disposing of a natural resource.  And the money spent on buying a tree could otherwise be spent on presents - assuming I ever get to buy any.  If I buy a fake tree, I'll have to hoard the damn thing in a closet for a year, again using money and taking up valuable space in an already crowded closet.     urlLink I'm thinking bamboo tree again this year.    Although, I am beginning to have the holiday spirit.  I'm hosting a Wine Club 'Holiday Sparkle' event tomorrow night - featuring champagnes ~ ooo la la - and on Thursday I have the hotel's holiday party to attend.   Trust me, no one parties like hotel people, so it should be a really good party.  Then Friday, my little diva will be performing in a holiday show.    Besides that, carols keep playing in my head against my will and my own better judgement.  So, you know, it's beginning to look a lot like Christmas.  *ha ha now that damn song will be playing in YOUR head too!*  Your welcome.  Diva out.         "

766556,female,indUnk,"        Worst comb-over ever  Last night I saw that the new Merriam Webster dictionary is out, and includes 10,000 new words.  Words that we use every day, but have never found in any dictionary ever before.  Words like hip hop, wack, dope and phat.  Also the word comb-over has been added.  When I saw that, I was instantly reminded of the worst comb-over I've ever seen.  Actually it was pretty recently, maybe just a week or two ago.  On Lincoln Road on South Beach, where everyone strives to be their absolute most fabulous at all times.  He was obviously from the Elvis-era.  He was in relatively good shape, considering his apparent age - I'm guessing late 50's to early 60's.  I can't even remember what he was wearing, since I was blinded by his comb-over.    Picture this if you dare:  Snow-white, Elvis side-burns, down the sides of his face to below the ears.  Then brushed w-a-y back,  over his ears  so that the ends met at the back of his mostly BALD head.   )(     As if we're not supposed to notice that he has no other hair except his sideburns.  Guys, please, if you're losing your hair and you're considering the comb-over... don't.  Go the way of MJ and Sean Connery, and just speed up nature's process by going bald.  Shave as you ruin nature's cruel joke with a mocking laugh at destiny, or be proud of your waning hairline.  Just be brave about the whole aging thing.

883178,male,Fashion,"            PB can be emotional, y'all.   I know some may describe me as crass, blunt, bitchy, tough...maybe even a little crazy.  But believe it or not, I'm probably the biggest sap you'll ever meet, although I may not show it right away.  And it could not have been more evident than it was today: I met Billygoat for lunch, on his way to the airport for his 2-1/2 month trip to Central America.  This morning I gathered the rest of his crap he left at my place, all of the mail that he still has coming to my house, and I was fully prepared just to give him his shit and tell him to take a hike.  But I couldn't...when I saw him, I just started to cry.  It's not that I'm not over him, because believe me, I am.  But the thought of saying good bye to anyone - boyfriend or not - to possibly never see him again, is a very sad prospect.  So I sat in this Thai restaurant, had a very cathartic cry (first time I cried since we officially called off the wedding), and said  goodbye . That's it.  My office mate summed up why this happened: 'Its very easy to be unhappy with someone you dont see.  So true, my friends.   Now, where the hell is my beer??           "

Not that I would actually  eat  24-7, but just knowing the food is there would bring me great happiness.  Jan scares me.   My lack of filters came out again today.  Thong was showing us a picture of this girl in TCW magazine (TCW stands for 'Today's Chicago Woman' - one of those free publications that shows you pictures of the so-called 'swanky' crowd at their snob parties hanging out with so-called 'celebrities' that happen to be in town...it's right up Thong's alley...the life she yearns for.)  Well, she told us that one of her friends told her she looked 'just like' one of the girls on the '51 Singles You Should Know' list.  This is just about the gayest 'article' ever - they ask these chachi's what their 'Turn-ons' are or, please, tell us about your 'Sense of Style'.  Barf.  There were actually 2 pictures of the girl Thong supposedly looked like.  In one of them she looked fairly normal, but a little bloated, and the other one was kind of a glamour-shot type pose.  Thong made the mistake of asking me which one she looked more like.  My response (pointing at the glamour-shot pose): 'You definitely look more like her.  She wears too much make-up.'

766556,female,indUnk,"        There's just no talking to some people   I am not what you would call a religious person.  I tend to keep out of Christian conversations, since I prefer to accept and respect all religions and beliefs.  Whatever works for you, you know?  Well, me and my big mouth.  I recieved this:  (This was a forward worth passing along!)          There is a chance our country may be going to war very soon.  My son and I were talking about numbers the other night.  In scripture, the number 3 represents the Holy Trinity.  I thought of calling for a day of prayer for our country.  When you may ask?  March 3, 2003. It would be 03-03-03.     Wouldn't it be great if all the Christians in the world or at least in our country would stop what they are doing and pray on the same day. We could make 03-03-03 God's Day.  Faith is the doorway that all miracles come through, but prayer is the key that unlocks the door.      What about all stopping activity together at 03:03 in the afternoon?  Then it would be 03-03-03-03-03.  And that won't happen again for another thousand years (in 3003).     I'm marking my calendar for 03-03.   If each of you pass this on to your friends and family, and they in turn to theirs, we could have a powerful prayer time on that date.  Please do your part..   And after some thought, responded like this: Dear All,     I was forwarded this message by one who you forwarded it to.  However well meaning the thought behind the message, I would like to make a suggestion.  Imagine how much more powerful this prayer would be if instead of asking only for Christians to pray, but for all people of all religions to pray.  Belief in prayer makes the difference, no matter whether you are praying to God, El, Buddha, Jehova, Krishna or Mohammed.  Accepting the power of prayer should be more about accepting the power of those who pray, with love and acceptance.  Just a thought to consider on 03/03/03  a world of prayers instead of a Christian sect of prayers could make that much greater a difference.  A few days later, I got THIS:   Excuse me, I am not trying to be rude, but the things that you just said, however 'well meant' are a complete and total lie, and I do not appreciate you forwarding your reply to the people on my list. You said that the power of prayer is 'the power of those that pray' ????!!! O.K. I guess that the murderer that prays to Mohammed, or Allah, Or anyone else, that by the way is dead, buried, and DID NOT rise again, it's o.k. because they are sincere. O.K. and they will be just as sincere when they bomb our country with a nuke right??? You need to think next time before you type. There is only one true God and His name is in the BIBLE. He is the only one that will hear any prayers, and THAT is the truth. I will be praying for your salvation, so that you may spend eternity in Heaven with God. Please feel free to write back. I do not speak these things out of meanness. I truly want you to know the truth. And what you said is as far from the truth as you can get. No one's prayers will be heard if sent to the wrong 'person' Just like if you send a package with no address it will be lost.    It never ceases to amaze me how incensed a 'Christian' becomes when you suggest there may be other valid beliefs out there. *sigh*    Is there no hope for peace?  I respect the zeal behind the response, but ::Murderer praying to Mohhamed:: ??  Please, dear readers, give me some sign of hope here.  What's you're point of view on this?  I would enjoy hearing back on this.  By the way, my response to her:  Well,  it is always good to hear other points of view.  Thank you for sharing yours with me.

You are in total seclusion from the hectic place called 'the world.'    5.   The soothing sound of a gentle waterfall fills the air with a cascade of serenity.    6.   The water is crystal clear.    7. You can easily see the face of the person you're holding underwater.          "
883178,male,Fashion,"            Bringing everyone down.    1. As a child, who was your favorite superhero/heroine? Why?   Yoda.  Im not sure why he was such a prominent figure in my childhood social circle probably had a lot to do with the fact that he talked/looked funny.  We used to spend a lot of time around the pond behind my parents house, and there was a place there that we called Yodas Bathroom.  I dont know why we gave him a bathroom, and no one else.  I also dont know why we didnt give him things like a bedroom, or a kitchen.  But Im sure it made sense at the time.    2. What was one thing you always wanted as a child but never got?   Grandparents.  They all died when I was pretty young.  Im often told that Im like my dads mother, which makes me happy and sad - she died before I was born.  The thing is, a relative inevitably tells me a story about when she was scamming or pawning something, or when she confronted some strange kid about being a greedy little bastard, or her habit of talking to paintings on the wall as if they were her (dead) sisters.  Then that person says, You remind me a lot of her.  Ive got a lot to look forward to.  This reminds me, earlier this week I was watching a morning program and they were showing this piece about a little kid (about 4?) whos favorite thing to do (aside from suction-cupping things to his stomach) is to take helium balloons to a nearby hillside and send them to his dead grandma.  She died when he was 2 years old, so he doesnt even really remember her.  I just lost it.   3. What's the furthest from home you've been?  Literally Prague?  Figuratively probably when I slept over at a friends house and her dad came home drunk and a little belligerent, so we hid upstairs.  It was apparently something she was really used to and I was really not used to.   4. What's one thing you've always wanted to learn but haven't yet?   To keep the old trap shut.   5. What are your plans for the weekend?  Gearing up for a week away - Im a nester so I like preparation.  That aside, social highlights include bowling/karoke Saturday and a church-shopping expedition on Sunday.           "
1708471,female,indUnk,"           I miss having sleepovers when I was like 10, it would consist of playing with barbies, eating popcorn, and watching a PG movie or being a rebel and watching a PG-13 one. And if you didn't fall asleep during the movie you would stay up for like 10 minutes talking about the crush you have on that guy that sits kiddy corner from you who always makes fun of you. Now they consist of your problems with people and the problems you yourself have and analyzing people. Way to complicated for me.   All I've been thinking about these last two days are how shallow people can be though, or how like spolied and greedy we all are. Christmas and the holidays are supposed to make you really happy and joyous and it's the time for giving, but honestly all I could think about when I opened the gifts was what have we come to when all we do is recieve more money and more shit from our parents? I know I'm greedy and want all this and keep it all, but I don't need it and it almost hurts to accept a gift when I should just send all the money over to some place that doesn't have anything. And then if I get a gift and dont' like it I feel even worse 'casue it's like they were trying to be gracious and benevolent and I'm turning them or it down because I simply don't like it because 'it's not my style' or 'it's stupid.' No, I just hate what everything has come down to. Trust me the holidays have been great, but I almost see no purpose in it for me and I don't like it. I feel an emptiness in me because I seriously don't have a point to celebrating anything. I also celebrate Hannukah, but I have no purpose in that either. I'm glad that I'm not freakishly religious, but I really do wish I had a religious background of some sort because half my family is jewish, the other half christian, and then I'm just there not having really any beliefs in anything and not knowing or feeling anything for the holidays. I guess it's just kind of frusturating.   Know what I realized? That half the people I like or have liked is not because of their personality, well it is, but most of the reasons that I've liked people a lot are because of the connection I've had with them. If I have a great feeling with someone, a great connection with someone and not anyone else, it's going to be hard for me to get rid of that feeling when I don't have it with anyone else. That's also a reason why it takes me so fricken long for me to get over someone. If I feel like I'm over them for like a week and haven't seen them for awhile, right when I see them again or anything, that connection is back and I like them again. Wow, things work in odd ways.   So sno daze is coming up on Feb. 14. Of course it's valentines day. Which ya is a good day to have a dance, but also very bad because then you want a date and you want a date that you like. If you come with a guy who's just a friend to this dance it's gonna be kinda odd, 'cause well it's valentines day. Enough said. All this means, that I'm going to have to think about who the hell I want to go with, which really I almost don't care, just someone good, and then I have to think about a dress. Wow, I hate dresses, but love them at the same time, they're kinda like guys in a sense. But I'm sick of wearing the big formal dresses to this dance, I know it's likt he most formal besides prom, but I want to do something different, I want something that's comfertable but looks really good and something that know one else will think of. I want my own style for this dance. It's either that or I'm borrowing a dress from someone which may be hard 'cause my ass is bigger than all my friends.... or ya I don't know maybe I'll be different for prom. Just wait and see. But ya and FYI, I do need a date if you didn't notice.   I offically hate school even more because they give you homework on your BREAK which really then isn't a break. I don't want to go back to that place. Good thing I have another week.   It's really weird when you're online and your sisters at a friends online and then they talk to you and tell you that they're all drunk and that your sister is passed out with a guy. And then when you realize it most likely really did happen, it's even weirder. This is funny, and kind of sad, but really seeing that I'm a good girl for the most part and have only drinken on my cruise, I really would want to get piss drunk with my friends now, just to have the experience. Yes I know this was all very random, but kiss my ass, ya'll know that you want to too if you haven't already. Plus I think I'm somewhat starting to become a rebel, yes me, because ya stress does weird shit to ya, it really does. But don't worry, ten bucks nothing happens.

766556,female,indUnk,"        Expanding on the last entry, Food for thought   Eliz commented, 'According to my psychologist... it's a mental health problem that I have. *giggle... It's correctible -- assuming that I truly wish to change.  According to my psychiatrist... the truth lies within myself. She can have her opinion, BUT the truth of the matter depends on how I view it.'  Makes me wonder about psychologists and therapists.  I mean, are we all supposed to be perfectly adjusted and balanced?  Are we all supposed to be free of any preferences or predisposed natures?  If the Drs. all had their way, we'd all be free of addictions, fears, anxieties, attitudes, truths and denials.    But, aren't those the things we bring with us into the world at large, that define us and motivate us?  Aren't those the very things we came into this world to learn from and to teach others about?    Eliz, your psychologist is right about one thing; the truth does lie within you.  Within all of us, as I believe.  And I am still wondering about my own personal koan right now, but not fretting too much over it.

2844168,female,Marketing,"                  Holiday Thoughts   I'm no theologian, but I have some pretty serious thoughts about Easter and Christmas. I've felt for a few years that something is missing in my life when it comes to these two monumental days. I guess Ked's rubbing off on me and I'm asking  urlLink What's the PO!NT?  Here's where I'm at.  A scene from a television show the other day keeps playing over and over in my head. The family was gathered around the table along with a few guests and they were celebrating the Passover. I furrowed my brow and began to contemplate a recurring thought that comes around every Christmas and Easter. I feel that my attendance at church on Sunday and maybe a Christmas Eve or Good Friday service just isn’t enough for me. Ked and I have discussed it quite frequently but we haven’t figured out a solution yet. Here are two events that radically changed my life, let alone the course of redemption for all humanity, and I go sit for an hour, think about it, and come home. We’ll have a great dinner with family and friends, but it always seems to me that something is missing. It’s one thing to gather around the table for Easter dinner, it’s quite another to sit down for Passover where every item on the table is a reminder of the journey God brought His people through. Sure, we celebrate the Lord’s Supper at church and while it’s significant it too seems to be lacking. We walk into church and sit through a forgettable half hour message (sorry to you pastors out there) and then for fifteen minutes we review Christ’s death and resurrection during the Supper and its over. That’s it. We go home and we’re on our merry way again. These events seem to merit more than just a little service at church and I can’t help but wonder what God really intended.   When I think of the Passover, it is an intense deal. I’m no scholar, but what I do know from reading the Old Testament was the Passover was   personal   - it was in your own home, with your family. There’s something to be said for readying your whole house and preparing a dinner that’s specific   purpose   is to remember something God did. And then there’s the Lord Supper. It too first took place in a   personal   setting -  Jesus with His twelve closest friends. It just seems to me that we have lost that familial meditation by leaving it to our local church to formulate the ritual for us, and even at that there isn’t much ritual to it.   I know, I know, for years we’ve tried to escape legalism and meaningless rituals. But that’s not what I’m talking about. My spirituality is crying to express itself in my home, through a meaningful tradition that is   personal and purposeful  , something I can pass on to my future kids, something we look forward to each year around those two holidays, something that as I prepare my home, those who live in it are also preparing their hearts and minds in anticipation, something that serves as a vivid reminder of what God did for us through Christ’s birth, death, and resurrection. I’m not looking for something to  make  me spiritual, but for a way to  express  my spirituality and immense gratitude for these two monumental events.   Please note , this is nothing against my family or my in-laws. I love our families and they have instilled in us an incredible foundation of faith and are stellar examples of cultivating Godly homes. I'm extremely grateful for them. When it comes to the issue of the holidays, I believe our families are like most traditional Christian families out there. I’m thinking that as the Body of Christ, we need to make more of an effort in our homes to make these particular holidays  personally and purposefully  focused on Christ. Presents and Easter baskets are fine and fun and should not be banished, but need to be generously supplemented with another tradition that serves as a reminder for the true meaning of the holidays. The Jews have the Passover, the Catholics have Lent, and we have well….nothing that takes place in our homes like that.   These thoughts are still raw and somewhat unformulated, so sorry for the rambling. I would love to hear your thoughts on the issue and what you have done or thought about doing in your own homes. Once I work through this, it could very well be my first book – Meaningful Homes for the Holidays.                 "

My regular woman was out sick...so I got someone else.  A man.  I've never trusted men to even do my dishes, let alone paint my nails.  If he was gay I may have had more faith.  But he wasn't.  He cut the hell out of my cuticles (they were bleeding).  He painted 'outside the lines'.  There wasn't even a much-awaited hand massage.  He sucked and it looks like a monkey painted my nails (which actually would have been an  excellent  b-day surprise, by the way).  I suppose after a few margaritas this evening, though, I won't notice I even  have  fingernails.         "

1550279,male,Student,"             Starting Tuesday we have exams, so I've been having to do exam reviews all weekend. I did do more than just that over the past 2 days though.   Friday:  Right after school, we had to finish filming our Theater Arts movie over at Highlander Stadium. There was a slight miscommunication between the athletic director and myself, so I almost had to sign a 1 million dollar liability waiver. Good thing Mr. Martin and Ms. Boyer help me take care of that issue. While I'm not going to name anyone specifically, there's one person that in my group that I honestly hope I never have to see again after this school year. Enough on that.  We also had our 2nd playoff game against Hillcrest on Friday. J.T. had a little bit of fun with me right before the game started, so I took a picture when I got home, and I'll put it up here. We won something like 12 or 13 to 1, so we play against someone else this next week. Not sure who, where, or if I'll even do it since it will be in the middle of exams.  Edit: Here's the picture of what J.T. did to me at the baseball game on Friday. I got quite a few comments about it...       Saturday:  Started working on my U.S. History exam review (since I'm not in AP). Mid-morning I left to go help someone get their DSL hooked up, but I couldn't do any more than just get all the hardware set up since DSL won't be activated until the 19th. Guess I know where I'll be going after exams one day...  I was gone the majority of the afternoon because I went to go see Van Helsing with my grandmother. I thought it was a pretty good movie; I liked it about as much as I did the first X-Men. Here's the list of the other movies that we're going to see this summer:     -Troy    -Shrek 2    -The Day after Tomorrow    -Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban    -The Chronicles of Riddick    -I, Robot    -The Bourne Supremacy    -King Arthur    -The Village  Nothing big happened last night, I just played a little FFXI and created this blog. Then went to sleep as my away message normally says.    Sunday:  Hmmmm....To-Do list for today:     -Finish U.S. History Exam Review    -Change script for Theater Arts movie    -Finish reading  Grapes of Wrath     -Upload picture from baseball and add it to this post    -Get movie clip to Andrew  And, yeah...that's about it. I need to read the Blogger help file this afternoon for uploading/linking pictures. Pretty sure it's the same as normal HTML (the rest of this markup is), but I just want to make sure.         "

It slowed down, made this deep, whirring growl, then just faded away.  I threw it out.  But now I'm wondering if I should have kept it for another day or two...

883178,male,Fashion,"           I can't disagree with what people are saying here.  I just have to take small exception with the  claim  that Bono said he won't play old stuff - there's been stuff from 'Boy' or 'October' (circa '80-'81), at almost all the shows I've been to, and they ALWAYS play stuff from 'War' (1983) and every subsequent albumn at every show.  And I certainly don't disagree that Bono is 'a guy with a microphone and an agenda', after all, I love that about him.  Same goes with the charge of cheesy-ness.  He's guilty - guilty of being earnest!  Em I buggin' ya?...  I also agree that Bjork was being subversive and rebellious at the Oscars.  No one in their right mind actually thought she put that on thinking 'this will fit in with any Vera Wang out there'.  But it was a bizarre and flaky thing to do.  I also loved it when the South Park guys arrived at the Oscars dressed in J-Lo and Gwyneth dresses.  It was weird and obnoxious.  But I laughed really hard, and its the only thing I remember anyone wearing from that year, plus, we're still talking about it, so it was genius.  Bottom line, U2 fans have to live with the fact that Bono can be perceived as pompous, and Bjork is a freak.  But they dont have to accept those as bad things.   I just hope this doesn't all come down to someone getting booted.  Er, wrong site...         "

I lost the box...my sweetness..my life...  four years was my forever. and forever is gone. it was taken away from me so fast that i didnt have the chance for any reaction. days past.....nights of slumber. i hear the past echoing in my ears...like a nightmare... late at night..i often cry... like all nights..like the night before yesterday.. and the night before that.  have you seen my soul?

3486574,female,Student,"       Haiz...today planning to go orchard to redeem my Jolin's Mini Concert tickets...Never know that there will be so many people redeeming it. I went out at noon...then when we reach there, it was around 1pm.. And when we got there..i am utterly shocked! There's already a LONG queue there...God, why am I always so 'sway'? But then, I was prepared for the worst...I knew even if i queue up together with the others, i definitely doesn't stand a chance....so, forget it. =[  And just to make myself feel better..I decided to catch a movie! Yep! And I wanted to watch the Day After Tomorrow..but Jiali wanted Shrek2...then we decided to see which movie comes first and decided on which one to watch. And in the end, Shrek 2 shows at 1.30pm and DAT is at 2pm...and I was like, 'Oh man...' Then I started to begged her on watch DAT instead. Then after some convincing, hehehe, I finally talked her into watch Day After Tomorrow instead! (Woohoo~) JiaLi rulez!! (LOlx)  Anyway, as I was saying...we bought the tickets and we have about an hour's time before the movie starts so we went to isetan (which is just below the cinema) and shop around. Haha, we've been to many departments...and like I said, there's a doll which looks REALLy like Jiali! Muahahaha..(oops hope she isn't reading this)and I told her that and she totally disagress with me..  Anyway, we went to the stationary department and I finally found the BLACK shaker!! Hehehehehe!! Well, I know I am wasting money but this is the only way to make me feel better after the loss of the 2 tickets for the Jolin's concert. And time flies, it is almost 2pm when the shows going to start. So we decided to go and make the preparations (like buying popcorns...lolx) And then we finally entered the cinema.  Wow! The show's REALLy awesome! It's the best movie I ever watched!! And Jiali even wanted for the toilet...but i told her not to go. Coz if she were to leave her seat, at any point of time, it's gonna be another great scene that she missed! And finally she tolerate through the whole movie. And it's absolutely a nice movie! So stimulating and romantic(for some parts). Especially how the girl hugs Sam when he was freezing cold after coming up from basement. And the most thrilling part is when the HUGE WAVES of seawater came rushing down to the city! And everyone is running for help...except for the girl who tries to help the old lady getting back her passport...Then Sam came to her resuce...and they are safe and sound! It's really a cool movie!! Like whaT DT have said...Haha  After coming out of the theatre, the first thing we did was rush to the toilet! And God! we didnt even manage to finish the popcorn! We left about 1/2 of the popcorns..coz both of us were to full to continue eating. And after sometimes, I keep talking to her that how great the movie is! And I am SO proud of myself that I told her to watch DAT instead of Shrek! Hehe, no la. Just kidding...lolx  Anyway, later we went over to heeren and planning to go over there and do some shopping..But then as I passed by popular, i decided to stop by and buy a couple of assesment books for myself. Coz my grades really have gone down! And I must do something about it this June Holidays!! Haiz...that means it's still looks like schooling for me...  After that, we went over to heeren...and on the way, jiali stomach pain...Told her to go toilet first liao, she dun listen..Like I always said 'Whenever you need a toilet you cant find one, whenever you dont need one, it keeps appearing' And I was absolutely right about this! She refused to go at first, and when we walked half way and about to heeren, she suddenly stomach pain! Then she say she can't stand it and have to go for the toilets. And luckily we reached there and she took quite a while before she comes out. And I was starting to get bored too, lolx!   Finally, we went to HMV...I was looking for the Marykate and Ashley's VCD..hoping that the price will go down. But instead, the VCD is gone! Haiz...sway lor..I guess. Then forget it, we headed for the bus and went back to BukitMerah Interchange to buy me and my mom's dinner. And then we went back home.  Oh yeah! I forgot that I need to buy the Lime Magazine where this month features quite a lot of my favourite people in it! Great! Really sway ar, today!!! Forget it!  Haiz...  Oh well, me go have dinner liao...  Laters!!         "

Sleeping in my own bed was enjoyable beyond comparison. woke up, drank coffee, fought with my sister, and stormed out of the house in a rage, towing Ahrodie along behind. Formulated plans to move out. Must leave. MUST LEAVE. Cleaned up SHERAYNA'S CHILDREN'S breakfast dishes. Will probably end up cleaning up her puppies poop, too. Thanks a bunch, 'big' sister. while blog-surfing, I came across Sarah Bobarah's blog.

She speaks about blogging bringing out the geek in everybody. I heartily agree.

Progress. As well, she seems to be rather well-behaved around smaller female dogs, and larger male dogs. odd. cringe moment: walking down the sidewalk, blinking tears of rage out of my eyes. I hate crying cause I'm mad. granola moment: lying on the grass in the shade in Maffeo-Sutton with Ahrodie. unfortunately the closeness of the ocean was not as comforting as it usually is. *disappointment* i plan to: hang with Kevin eventually after I finish the current babysitting of Rob and Kaelyn. Steven might have croup so Sherayna's taking him, and the baby to the doctor's.  :(       "

Well, if you live in a place that can become an inferno in less than 2 hours you would. Temperatures around 38C are expected later this week, that means it will probably feel like 45C in this humidity saturated hell hole. To the imperialists, 45C is way too hot.   But it is a bit unfair to call it a hell hole, it can be a beautiful place, with gorgeous mountain framed sunsets and spectacular cloud effects. I enjoy watching the mountain every time I drive home from work. I can get lost in its deep misty ravines and am myself mystified by its white faces of rock around its tops.

589736,male,Technology,"           Ben - Honestly I did not read the entire article.  When I started seeing where it was going with the tone of it being a Republican/republican conspiracy AND saw that I was maybe a third of the way through, I did stop reading.  I tried to be clear that I was not attcking Ben Haley directly with my thoughts on the response to the 2000 elections by saying the collective you.  I used your name just to make sure you saw it, since you posted the original article.  I apolgize for the force of my reposne, but it set me off yesterday.  I get a little tired of the 'corporations are evil' and 'corporations have the Republicans in their pockets' attitudes.  Assuming for a moment that the second is true (which I do not agree with since most corporations grease the palms of just about any politician, regardless of party affiliation, to make sure they have access to power brokers),  a corporation is going to do what it can to make sure it stays profitable.  To assist with that, they need to be able to influence politicians.  It is generally easier to influence someone to you point of view if they are already close to it to begin with.  Conservitives tend to favor less taxes and less government than liberals.  This fact automatically puts the corporations more towards the conservatives.  The voting machines/software/hardware have to be made by someone.  The entities that can most easily do it are corporations.  Let's say for a second that a bunch of hackers got together and made some apparently good software.  Should the software be mistrusted because the hackers tend to be less concerned with laws of society?  Not if it works.  Now, the whole restriction on who can review the raw data, uh-uh, that is bogus.  I can see making the non-corporate personnel signing a non-disclosure agreement about whatever they see in the guts of the machine, but the integrity of the system has to come first.  And not using the full capabilities of the software (thermal imaging to keep track of what part of the screen was touched), why bother having it if you are not going to use it.  My main umbrage was the implied tone of the article that Republicans are pulling all these strings behind the scenes and that we are all evil bastards complicit in the grand conspiracy to make sure we are in control.  I initially thought you sneaked a Salon.com article by me.  I was a little shocked to see that someone in the UK would be that interested in our politics.  Again, Ben, I apologize if you thought my response was directly aimed at you.  I can see why you would think that (since I did use your name in my first sentence), but it really was not.  Now, if you will please excuse me while I attend my weekly strategy meeting for keeping the masses under control....             "

3734462,female,Arts,"       I once read that 'Much of your pain is self-chosen. It is the bitter potion by which the physician within you heals your sick self.'. i know that all this pain that i feel is caused by myself. For the reasons that i havnt forgotten nor have forgiven the person who caused this. Many times i told myself that I am ok. I have forgiven. I dont want to hate.that will be the last thing i want to do. For so long I have searched for answers on how to make my life a complete solace. I have loved. I loved more than myself. For love cannot be measured.A person under the spell acnnot say i will devote myself to you 80% and the rest is for mine. For when you love, you love without limitations.Surpass even your own restrictions.  Dont get me wrong, I can say that being with Him was the best and happiest moments of my life. I learned a lot.On how to be a woman as i am now.On how to love without expectaions. He was not just someone im inlove with..but he was a companion..a bestfriend...then was a fiance.  They say things happen for a reason.That was what is inculcated in my head right now.So there is no room for hate..for questions.I did not say anything. I diod not ask. I swallowed the circumstances like a bitter pill.  'Beware of the man who does not return your blow: he neither forgives you nor allows you to forgive yourself.' Maybe i shoul have asked why. It would be better if i hurt him. but i did not. I was not given a chance to do so. So here i am.   Always forgive your enemies—but never forget their names.As i type this down, I realized that 'forgiveness' is not for anybody else. Forgiveness is for myself. I have to let go. I have to Forgive. Not for him. But for me to regain myuself again.   But is forgiving also forgetting? let me know.     "

Because of the torture I endure every month, I was not surprised with my diagnosis. In a way it helps to know what's causing the pain and to know that I am not a hypochondriac. There's a cause for what I feel. So I'm glad I have some sort of explanation.  &nbsp;  Dr. Ambrosine* removed all the endo she could, using a laser (or possibly a light sabre), and also scraped some polyps out of my poor battered uterus.

2821801,female,indUnk,"           This deserves more than just a link, the original can be found on  urlLink Kim DuToits  blog.  We have become a nation of women.  It wasn't always this way, of course. There was a time when men put their signatures to a document, knowing full well that this single act would result in their execution if captured, and in the forfeiture of their property to the State. Their wives and children would be turned out by the soldiers, and their farms and businesses most probably given to someone who didn't sign the document.  There was a time when men went to their certain death, with expressions like 'You all can go to hell. I'm going to Texas.' (Davy Crockett, to the House of Representatives, before going to the Alamo.)  There was a time when men went to war, sometimes against their own families, so that other men could be free. And there was a time when men went to war because we recognized evil when we saw it, and knew that it had to be stamped out.  There was even a time when a President of the United States threatened to punch a man in the face and kick him in the balls, because the man had the temerity to say bad things about the President's daughter's singing.  We're not like that anymore.   Now, little boys in grade school are suspended for playing cowboys and Indians, cops and crooks, and all the other familiar variations of 'good guy vs. bad guy' that helped them learn, at an early age, what it was like to have decent men hunt you down, because you were a lawbreaker.  Now, men are taught that violence is bad -- that when a thief breaks into your house, or threatens you in the street, that the proper way to deal with this is to 'give him what he wants', instead of taking a horsewhip to the rascal or shooting him dead where he stands.  Now, men's fashion includes not a man dressed in a three-piece suit, but a tight sweater worn by a man with breasts.  Now, warning labels are indelibly etched into gun barrels, as though men have somehow forgotten that guns are dangerous things.  Now, men are given Ritalin as little boys, so that their natural aggressiveness, curiosity and restlessness can be controlled, instead of nurtured and directed.  And finally, our President, who happens to have been a qualified fighter pilot, lands on an aircraft carrier wearing a flight suit, and is immediately dismissed with words like 'swaggering', 'macho' and the favorite epithet of Euro girly-men, 'cowboy'. Of course he was bound to get that reaction -- and most especially from the Press in Europe, because the process of male pussification Over There is almost complete.  How did we get to this?  In the first instance, what we have to understand is that America is first and foremost, a culture dominated by one figure: Mother. It wasn't always so: there was a time when it was Father who ruled the home, worked at his job, and voted.  But in the twentieth century, women became more and more involved in the body politic, and in industry, and in the media -- and mostly, this has not been a good thing. When women got the vote, it was inevitable that government was going to become more powerful, more intrusive, and more 'protective' (ie. more coddling), because women are hard-wired to treasure security more than uncertainty and danger. It was therefore inevitable that their feminine influence on politics was going to emphasize (lowercase 's') social security.  I am aware of the fury that this statement is going to arouse, and I don't care a fig.  What I care about is the fact that since the beginning of the twentieth century, there has been a concerted campaign to denigrate men, to reduce them to figures of fun, and to render them impotent, figuratively speaking.  I'm going to illustrate this by talking about TV, because TV is a reliable barometer of our culture.  In the 1950s, the TV Dad was seen as the lovable goofball -- perhaps the beginning of the trend -- BUT he was still the one who brought home the bacon, and was the main source of discipline (think of the line: 'Wait until your father gets home!').  From that, we went to this: the Cheerios TV ad.  Now, for those who haven't seen this piece of shit, I'm going to go over it, from memory, because it epitomizes everything I hate about the campaign to pussify men. The scene opens at the morning breakfast table, where the two kids are sitting with Dad at the table, while Mom prepares stuff on the kitchen counter. The dialogue goes something like this:  Little girl (note, not little boy): Daddy, why do we eat Cheerios? Dad: Because they contain fiber, and all sorts of stuff that's good for the heart. I eat it now, because of that. LG: Did you always eat stuff that was bad for your heart, Daddy? Dad (humorously): I did, until I met your mother. Mother (not humorously): Daddy did a lot of stupid things before he met your mother.  Now, every time I see that TV ad, I have to be restrained from shooting the TV with a .45 Colt. If you want a microcosm of how men have become less than men, this is the perfect example.  What Dad should have replied to Mommy's little dig: Yes, Sally, that's true: I did do a lot of stupid things before I met your mother. I even slept with your Aunt Ruth a few times, before I met your mother.  That's what I would have said, anyway, if my wife had ever attempted to castrate me in front of the kids like that. But that's not what men do, of course. What this guy is going to do is smile ruefully, finish his cereal, and then go and fuck his secretary, who doesn't try to cut his balls off on a daily basis. Then, when the affair is discovered, people are going to rally around the castrating bitch called his wife, and call him all sorts of names. He'll lose custody of his kids, and they will be brought up by our ultimate modern-day figure of sympathy: The Single Mom.  You know what? Some women deserve to be single moms.  When I first started this website, I think my primary aim was to blow off steam at the stupidity of our society.   Because I have fairly set views on what constitutes right and wrong, I have no difficulty in calling Bill Clinton, for example, a fucking liar and hypocrite.   But most of all, I do this website because I love being a man. Amongst other things, I talk about guns, self-defense, politics, beautiful women, sports, warfare, hunting, and power tools -- all the things that being a man entails. All this stuff gives me pleasure.  And it doesn't take much to see when all the things I love are being threatened: for instance, when Tim Allen's excellent comedy routine on being a man is reduced to a fucking sitcom called Home Improvement. The show should have been called Man Improvement, because that's what every single plotline entailed: turning a man into a 'better' person, instead of just leaving him alone to work on restoring the vintage sports car in his garage. I stopped watching the show after about four episodes.  ('The Man Show' was better, at least for the first season -- men leering at chicks, men fucking around with ridiculous games like 'pin the bra on the boobies', men having beer-drinking competitions, and women on trampolines. Excellent stuff, only not strong enough. I don't watch it anymore, either, because it's plain that the idea has been subverted by girly-men, and turned into a parody of itself.)  Finally, we come to the TV show which to my mind epitomizes everything bad about what we have become: Queer Eye For The Straight Guy. Playing on the homo Bravo Channel, this piece of excrement has taken over the popular culture by storm (and so far, the only counter has been the wonderful South Park episode which took it apart for the bullshit it is).  I'm sorry, but the premise of the show nauseates me. A bunch of homosexuals trying to 'improve' ordinary men into something 'better' (ie. more acceptable to women): changing the guy's clothes, his home decor, his music -- for fuck's sake, what kind of girly-man would allow these simpering butt-bandits to change his life around?  Yes, the men are, by and large, slobs. Big fucking deal. Last time I looked, that's normal. Men are slobs, and that only changes when women try to civilize them by marriage. That's the natural order of things.  You know the definition of homosexual men we used in Chicago? 'Men with small dogs who own very tidy apartments.'  Real men, on the other hand, have big fucking mean-ass dogs: Rhodesian ridgebacks, bull terriers and Rottweilers, or else working dogs like pointers or retrievers which go hunting with them and slobber all over the furniture.   Women own lapdogs.  Which is why women are trying to get dog-fighting and cock-fighting banned -- they'd ban boxing too, if they could -- because it's 'mean and cruel'. No shit, Shirley. Hell, I don't like the idea of fighting dogs, either, but I don't have a problem with men who do. Dogs and cocks fight. So do men. No wonder we have an affinity for it.  My website has become fairly popular with men, and in the beginning, this really surprised me, because I didn't think I was doing anything special.  That's not what I think now. I must have had well over five thousand men write to me to say stuff like 'Yes! I agree! I was so angry when I read about [insert atrocity of choice], but I though I was the only one.'  No, you're not alone, my friend, and nor am I.  Out there, there is a huge number of men who are sick of it. We're sick of being made figures of fun and ridicule; we're sick of having girly-men like journalists, advertising agency execs and movie stars decide on 'what is a man'; we're sick of women treating us like children, and we're really fucking sick of girly-men politicians who pander to women by passing an ever-increasing raft of Nanny laws and regulations (the legal equivalent of public-school Ritalin), which prevent us from hunting, racing our cars and motorcycles, smoking, flirting with women at the office, getting into fistfights over women, shooting criminals and doing all the fine things which being a man entails.  When Annika Sorenstam was allowed to play in that tournament on the men's PGA tour, all the men should have refused to play -- Vijay Singh was the only one with balls to stand up for a principle, and he was absolutely excoriated for being a 'chauvinist'. Bullshit. He wasn't a chauvinist, he was being a man. All the rest of the players -- Woods, Mickleson, the lot -- are girls by comparison. And, needless to say, Vijay isn't an American, nor a European, which is probably why he still has a pair hanging between his legs, and they're not hanging on the wall as his wife's trophy.  Fuck this, I'm sick of it.  I don't see why I should put up with this bullshit any longer -- hell, I don't see why any man should put up with this bullshit any longer.  I don't see why men should have become feminized, accept that we allowed it to happen -- and you know why we let it happen? Because it's goddamned easier to do so. Unfortunately, we've allowed it to go too far, and our maleness has become too pussified for words.  At this point, I could have gone two ways: the first would be to say, '...and I don't know if we'll get it back. The process has become too entrenched, the cultural zeitgeist of men as girls has become part of the social fabric, and there's not much we can do about it.'  But I'm not going to do that. To quote John Belushi (who was, incidentally, a real man and not a fucking woman): 'Did we quit when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor?'  Well, I'm not going to quit. Fuck that. One of the characteristics of the non-pussified man (and this should strike fear into the hearts of women and girly-men everywhere) is that he never quits just because the odds seem overwhelming. Omaha Beach, guys.  I want a real man as President -- not Al Gore, who had to hire a consultant to show him how to be an Alpha male, and french-kiss his wife on live TV to 'prove' to the world that he was a man, when we all knew that real men don't have to do that shit.  And I want the Real Man President to surround himself with other Real Men, like Rumsfeld, and Ashcroft, and yes, Rice (who is more of a Real Man than those asswipes Colin Powell and Norman Mineta).  I want our government to be more like Dad -- kind, helpful, but not afraid to punish us when we fuck up, instead of helping us excuse our actions.  I want our government of real men to start rolling back the Nanny State, in all its horrible manifestations of over-protectiveness, intrusiveness and 'Mommy Knows Best What's Good For You' regulations.  I want our culture to become more male -- not the satirical kind of male, like The Man Show, or the cartoonish figures of Stallone, Van Damme or Schwartzenegger. (Note to the Hollywood execs: We absolutely fucking loathe chick movies about feelings and relationships and all that feminine jive. We want more John Waynes, Robert Mitchums, Bruce Willises, and Clint Eastwoods. Never mind that it's simplistic -- we like simple, we are simple, we are men -- our lives are uncomplicated, and we like it that way. We Were Soldiers was a great movie, and you know why? Because you could have cut out all the female parts, and it still would have been a great movie, because it was about Real Men. Try cutting out all the female parts in a Woody Allen movie -- you'd end up with the opening and closing credits.)  I want our literature to become more male, less female. Men shouldn't buy 'self-help' books unless the subject matter is car maintenance, golf swing improvement or how to disassemble a fucking Browning BAR. We don't improve ourselves, we improve our stuff.  And finally, I want men everywhere to going back to being Real Men. To open doors for women, to drive fast cars, to smoke cigars after a meal, to get drunk occasionally and, in the words of Col. Jeff Cooper, one of the last of the Real Men: 'to ride, shoot straight, and speak the truth.'  In every sense of the word. We know what the word 'is' means.  Because that's all that being a Real Man involves. You don't have to become a fucking cartoon male, either: I'm not going back to stoning women for adultery like those Muslim assholes do, nor am I suggesting we support that perversion of being a Real Man, gangsta rap artists (those fucking pussies -- they wouldn't last thirty seconds against a couple of genuine tough guys that I know).  Speaking of rap music, do you want to know why more White boys buy that crap than Black boys do? You know why rape is such a problem on college campuses? Why binge drinking is a problem among college freshmen?  It's a reaction: a reaction against being pussified. And I understand it, completely. Young males are aggressive, they do fight amongst themselves, they are destructive, and all this does happen for a purpose.  Because only the strong men propagate.  And women know it. You want to know why I know this to be true? Because powerful men still attract women. Women, even liberal women, swooned over George Bush in a naval aviator's uniform. Donald Trump still gets access to some of the most beautiful pussy available, despite looking like a medieval gargoyle. Donald Rumsfeld, if he wanted to, could fuck 90% of all women over 50 if he wanted to, and a goodly portion of younger ones too.  And he won't. Because Rummy's been married to the same woman for fifty years, and he wouldn't toss that away for a quickie. He's a Real Man. No wonder the Euros hate and fear him.  We'd better get more like him, we'd better become more like him, because if we don't, men will become a footnote to history.  ********* Sha-zam.         "

2844168,female,Marketing,"                  Tropical Adventures of the Fab Four Day #5   Yesterday was a nice relaxing day thanks to Kurt and his sunburn! He was not interested in going to the beach again so we hung out here for most of the day. He and Ked worked on pasting together 11 of Kurt's panoramic photos from Alaska and then they worked on getting Kurt & Michelle each set up with their own blogs. Michelle & I decided that the boys were boring, so we headed down to the pool for a couple hours and had a fabulous time chatting and working on our tans!  Later in the afternoon we headed out to see Van Helsing. It was kinda scary!! But it was good, and Hugh Jackman always does a great job. After the movie we headed over to Bucca Di Beppo's for some giant pizza!! It was delicious! Then Kurt insisted we run through Target (because he misses them so much! ha!) for some aloe lotion for his sunburn. Then we headed back to our place and vegged some more. Actually, we watched ramp on TV. It was hilarious because the movie is so old and the sound effects were cheesy. They used the same sound for a gunshot as they did for a missile. I think we had more fun making fun of the movie than actually watching it.  Anyway, today is their last day here and I think we're taking it easy again today!                  "
2844168,female,Marketing,"          As Kerry stood looking stoic before the body of Ronald Reagan what was he thinking?    In 1984 campaign literature John Kerry writes:  “We are continuing a defense buildup that is consuming our resources with weapons systems that we don’t need and can’t use.   “The Reagan Administration has no rational plan for our military. Instead, it acts on misinformed assumptions about the strength of the Soviet military and a presumed ‘window of vulnerability,’ which we now know not to exist.   “And Congress, rather than having the moral courage to challenge the Reagan Administration, has given Ronald Reagan almost every military request he has made, no matter how wasteful, no matter how useless, no matter how dangerous.   “The biggest defense buildup since World War II has not given us a better defense. Americans feel more threatened by the prospect of war, not less so. And our national priorities become more and more distorted as the share of our country’s resources devoted to human needs diminishes.”  As we look at the accomplishments of Ronald Reagan and remember that it was his policies that helped tear down the wall of communism, you have to wonder if Kerry will always be on the wrong side of history.  Mr. Kerry - keep the photo ops coming, but we know how you really feel.         "

As a matter of fact, there aren’t even 1 billion jobs in the world today.   What does this mean for you?       You have plenty of competition in your industry and the numbers aren’t getting any smaller. There is a new person born in your industry every minute. So for you to stay in the elite crowd or join the elite crowd in your industry you have to create what I call a “Distinguished Identity.”   What makes you special in your industry?  What have you done that very few have done in your industry?  What can and what will you provide on a guaranteed basics?        These are all questions that employers want to see within you. The job of the employer is often tough because they have to search to find out what’s within an individual. The employer or recruiter has to search if nothing stands out to be beneficial to the job. Most employers are to mature to go hide and go seek, so don’t hide behind the tree.          The key is to make yourself into a shining bright light like the sun if you will. Make it easy for employers to see your benefits, and they will find it much easier to hire you. What is one way you can separate yourself from the crowd and become the first star to shine bright at night?  Let me tell you a secret…       Did you know that fewer than 15% of people who have a career DON”T have a career portfolio. I willing to bet that in your industry it’s way smaller than 10%. What is a career portfolio?       A well-prepared portfolio that provides 'evidence' to an employer of your accomplishments, skills, abilities--it documents the scope and quality of your experience and training in the proper manner.       A career portfolio reveals everything an employer wants to know about you. Remember an employer usually doesn’t hire an individual if there are unanswered questions. So you want to make sure tat every question is answered promptly, vividly and clearly.  ======================================================== David Green is an author and hiring manager of Distinguish  Marketing, LLC.

3568056,male,Sports-Recreation,"           happy friday!  there were a lot of pretty good performances last night by pitchers, only one that i would call a great one, so we will lead off w/ that one.  here it goes: yesterdays best: z. day Mtl: 9 IP, W, 0 ER, 6 H, 0 BB, 4 K against the royals.  day has been doing well this year, despite a 5-6 record, he has an ERA of 3.12.  if he gets some more run support, either through offense or a trade, he could win 15+ a season.  he is a very good young pitcher. c. zambrano ChC: 8 IP, W, 2 ER, 5 H, 4 BB, 7 K.  he is a top 5 pitcher so far this season IMO (schmidt, r johnson, a. benitez, clemens). 7-2 with a 2.27 ERA.  his curveball has a lot more on it this year than what i have seen before.  he is able to depend on that pitch as well, and i think that he has potential to maintain this all season. c. fossum Ari: 6 IP, W, 0 ER, 5 H, 2 BB, 5 K over Bal.  his counterpart, bautista for Baltimore had a perfect game thru 5 or 6 i think, but gave up a 3 run shot the next inning. this was definitely an aberration (he got his ERA below 6), so i wouldnt look for another similar performance any time soon. c. pavano Fla: 8.2 IP, W, 1 ER, 4 H, 1 BB, 7 K.  another pitcher quietly having a good season.  while beckett and burnett are struggling, pavano has been the marlins' rock in the rotation.  2nd straight very good start (6/4 7.2 IP, W, 1 ER), and 6-2, 3.10 on season.  he might be peaking right now, so i dont know if i would hold on to him for the rest of the season. k. ishii LA: 8 IP, W, 1 ER, 6 H, 1 BB, 4 K. also having a good season (8-3, 3.36).  he is getting a bit more run support than last year, not by much, but more nonetheless.  he has shown improvement each of the last 3 yrs, especially w/ his control. c. schilling Bos: 7 IP, W, 2 ER, 6 H, 2 BB, 8 K.  always good for a solid performance, schilling has had a consistent season. for his price, you could probably get a marginally better pitcher, but he is not going to let you down very often.  if you have the money, he is a smart pickup.  those were the best performances of last night.  some pitchers to look for good things from tonight are: livan hernandez Mtl: plays at seattle tonight, who has been a struggling offensive team.  hernandez is known as an inning-eater, so i will predict 7.2 IP, 2 ER, 5 H, and a win (why not go for it all w/ my predictions?) tim hudson Oak: a safe enough pick, playing at home v. Pit, whose offense had been struggling, although they scored 7 yesterday.  i will say 7 IP, 3 ER, 7 H, and a win for tim.  i think the A's can match however many runs the pirates throw up there. al leiter NYM: has an ERA this season below 2 (1.78 i think).  playing against KC only enhances my confidence in him.  i kind of want to say CG shutout, but leiter probably doesnt have that much endurance in him.  7 IP, 1 ER, 2 H, win. brett myers Phi: plays at Min, home of the 'evil ventilation system'.  he will overcome this hardship and get a win in 6.1 innings.  he will give up 3 ER and 6 H. i know this to be a fact (not really...had you fooled there) scott schoeneweis Chisox: my 'out on a limb' pick for the night, he had a great rookie year 3ish yrs ago (along w/ rick ankiel), and has done well this season as well. performance of the night v. Atl-CG 3-hitter, 1 unearned run, 2 BB, 9 K, win.  there you have it, who says i dont have the balls to predict stuff?  hope this is helpful and accurate.  if you find any errors, you will get mentioned in my next post, and maybe you will win a new car!  any comments regarding format and or content are always welcome.  good luck, and have a good one!

This involved a lot of shooting of rats, bugs and crabs.   At one point on Tatooine, I was standing next to a mission terminal waiting for my turn to use it when I saw a large wookie run past me, firing wildly over his shoulder as a tiny crab no bigger than a dinner plate chased him through town. How sad, I thought to myself. I spent countless hours wandering the hillsides in search of new rats and crabs to shoot. Sometimes I would inadvertently stumble upon too large a rat and be forced to high tail it back to town. I placed my character in 'auto run' and pointed him at the nearest town.   As I sat there staring at my Trandoshan bounding across the uneven Tatooine landscape with some kind of super rat closing in on him, I thought to myself, This is not how I want to play in the Star Wars Universe.

My morning was spent with our new friend Ben at at the Apple Store. Finally, someone there with some class and patience (though it was his last day there!) He handled a lot of my post-crash problems (reinstalling os9, etc) so I can get back into musical shape and he then addressed the physical problems facing this beaten-down Powerbook. I won't get into details, but its only 2 years old and looks like its been around for triple that. This stems from the fact that this computer has been all over the world with me and never stays in the same spot too long. You would think they would make these things a bit sturdier. Anyhow, lets just say Ben gave me the rock star treatment and this laptop will be as good as new by the time I return from Paris. Just so you know, his last two 'celebrity' clients at apple were myself (!) and Claire Danes, who i think he now has a crush on.  The rest of the day was spent interacting with lots of cool people. Observe:  Ash and I had a fun exchange all day via E-mail. I finally showed him my first piece for Ass Cobra and he started out REALLY liking it, and then in his own 'special' (as in special ed) Ash way, we had pretty much trashed the whole thing. HOWEVER, he gave me the music finally, which wil serve as the soundtrack to my European vacation. Hopefully, by the time I get back I'll have my head around the Cobra and get into it. Ash, Robin and Charles have an excellent new song called THREE WEEKS, which I am very fond of. I love that I be a fan of this band...  Leo V23 has found his way onto I-Chat, which is a big pleasant surprise for me. Instead of now waiting every month to see him and exchange new music, we now have the direct line. As he prepares for his first official gig as AM PACIFC, he sent me a new song called 11:11 which is one of the best things he has ever done. I'm sad I will be missing this gig for sure, but he knows my schedule and hopefully can book around it next time I'm in LA. As I type. we are trading various rarities, live tracks, etc from the likes of Cerati and Fresco, et al.  As if this isn't even a crazier day, Joe Saintface and I had a brief but nice exchange regarding the status of the new Saintface album. Regular readers of this blog will know that I am somewhat impatiently waiting for this album. It seems Joe is too. Supposedly, it was officially finished last night, though I will believe it when D'orge hears it, know what I mean? However, Peter, prepare to be stalked by your number 1 fan. I leave TUESDAY and need this in my I-Pod!  Speaking of Mr. Face, I might have failed to mention that a few E-exchanges with Peter have taken place this week regarding the second of the HF songs he is singing for EXIT STRATEGIES called CLEAN UP. He sent in his suggested edit for the song, most of which I didn't have a problem with other than the fact that he totally cut everything I loved about the song (Read: F-bass parts). Needless to say, he trimmed the song by two minutes, which it totally needed, but I think and shortened version of the long F-bass parts will come back as a bridge somewhere. The compromise should be very easy to figure out once he finishes the vocals.   Meanwhile, while Mr. Louche celebrates his anniversary and in preparation of our socializing in London next week, I have presented him a 'gameplan', which outlines some of what could be our immediate musical future together. Yes that sounds gay, but hopefully down the line, and if all goes according to plan you Louche fans will be happy labheads a year or two from now. Watch this space  I keep hoping Irene falls asleep watching TROY so I can watch the OASIS gig I taped on Trio this afternoon while we were at dinner. Fingers crossed!

883178,male,Fashion,"            Explosion Avoidance/My Longest Rant Ever (PB, don't kick me out)   Sometimes, I feel like I will explode if I don't write something.  Today, what's stuck in my craw is  urlLink this.   Here's why:  1.   'Put an end  to the spoiled, disrespectful, ungrateful pro-peacers who don't know the meaning of sacrifice.'  How should we put an end to them?  Oh, I have an idea: we can use all the electric chairs and gas chambers that are under-utilized in America (that's sarcasm BTW).  Just so I'm clear, is this man really suggesting that we kill Americans who don't 'support the troops'?  2.  There is a sign that says France Sucks.  I could write a book on what bugs me about that, but I will try to be brief.  First, the government of France does not support this war.  The French people are divided on it (like the people of all nations of the world).  The country of France (its people) is different from the government of France.  That's why we are targeting this war at the government of Iraq and not at the country of Iraq and certainly not at the Iraqi people.  It is possible to oppose the government but not the whole country.  What is the value of all this hatred of France?  Second, France was acting on what it believed.  They have an obligation to do so, just as we do.  Third, I'm not sure France is wrong.  It is difficult to argue that diplomatic measures were exhausted before the bombing began.  U.N. Resolution 1441 clearly does not authorize this action and requires a second resolution to sanction the use of force.  The inability of the U.S. to secure U.N. Security Council approval for this effort is not the fault of France (recognize that we have the responsibility for making a case for war - and we failed to do it; recognize further that France was not the only country that planned to veto the Security Council Resolution - should we hate Russia too?  Should we hate everyone who disagrees with us?  Should I hate the man who hates people who love peace?  Where does all this hate leave us?  What would Jesus do?).    3.  I don't even know what to write about the Freedom chainsaw.  I really don't.  I have thought about it all morning, and I still don't have any coherent thought in response.  People trouble me is about all I can come up with.  Here's the thing:  1.  I support our troops.  I also feel really sorry for them.   2.  I suspect our fighting men and women know that this war is not entirely on the up and up.  Troops during Operation Desert Storm talked about 'why they were there' all the time.  They were open in their speculation about whether the war was about oil.  Troops in Vietnam were candid about the impropriety of American involvement there.  Our soldiers know more than most Americans that it is almost impossible to make a case that Saddam should be removed while allowing other regimes to remain in power (see my fourth point below).   3.  Questioning the war does not mean failing to support our troops (perhaps this is so basic and so easy that it escapes people's minds).  It is possible to hate the war and love the soldier.  In many ways, love of soldier compels us to question and challenge war.  4.  The men and women fighting in Iraq are  not  protecting  our  freedom.  While one may argue that Iraq is a threat to the U.S.  Only strained reasoning would allow that argument to hold any water.  First, Iraq has no weaponry capable of reaching the United States.  Their missile range is not only capped at a few hundred miles, but also so grossly inaccurate that the missiles, even if they could fly the several thousand miles to the U.S., would be more likely to hit Baghdad than Boston.  Second, let's be honest, Iraq's main threat is to Israel.  Our men and women are more involved to protect Israel than the U.S.  Third, Iraq's minimal weaponry is significantly less threatening to the U.S. than the nuclear weapons possessed by countries like Pakistan, Iran, Libya, North Korea (recently awakened by sloppy foreign policy), Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan.  If we are really interested in  protecting our freedom  by eliminating possession of weapons of mass destruction by unstable regimes, then what the hell are we doing in Iraq?  If we were to rank direct threats to the security of the U.S., I'm not even sure Iraq would make the top twenty (even if you factor in terrorism - the C.I.A. all but admitted that there is no connection between Iraq and Al Queda).     5.  I will bet anyone $100 that our troops come back with some kind of syndrome or another.  (Let history be your teacher here:  there are the effects of Agent Orange exposure to our Vietnam era veterans (finally admitted after a few decades of U.S. government denial); and there is the currently denied Gulf War Syndrome).  I will add to the bet that Iraqi war veterans will be under-supported by the government, that they will find little financial assistance for necessary medical care and that they will be directed to woefully over-crowded and horribly under-funded VA hospitals.  I bet that, to the extent that their effects include mental instability and violent behavior, they will meet with little or no understanding from our criminal justice system.  Last, I bet that many of the folks who attended weekend rallies in support of our troops will either:  a) remain silent when soldiers return and need our support; b) vote for tax cuts that further undermine the ability of agencies charged with supporting veterans to actually provided meaningful support; or c) both.     6.  The essence of democracy is freedom.  One of the freedoms we are supposed to value as citizens in a democracy (I'll save my arguments on why we are not a democracy for later) is the freedom of speech (this is so basic that the inability to understand it shocks and frightens me).  The freedom of speech defends and supports the right of the citizenry to express their opinion. It is not limited to voices that support the government (and perhaps has most value in dissent).  We have a long line of famous dissenters in the United States.  Abraham Lincoln was a prominent in his opposition to the Spanish-American war.  Richard Nixon campaigned on getting our troops out of Vietnam  even while soldiers were there fighting .  If we take away dissent, we are not free.   7.  The illogic of claiming to support troops who are fighting for our freedom and seeking to silence those who exercise freedom in dissent is so visceral and so removed from reason that it depresses me.    How can something so basic be so little understood?          "

4192173,male,Technology,"             Hello my friends. While taking holiday in eastern Europe I have gone for a record ten days without doing the following: checking my voicemail, checking my email, checking the DrudgeReport and checking the MOGworld blog. It is with great anticipation that I review all of these the moment I land in the USofA.  So, how am I able to type this now? Well, I am actually typing in into MS Word now – fortunately I have borrowed my legal gf’s laptop for the flight home – I have blogging as well as an Advertising take home final to attend to. I ended up borrowing this laptop because she is actually on a different flight than I – she is flying KLM back to JFK. Long story short, I was supposed to fly out on AirFrance tonight at 6.55p local time but since her flight was this AM at 10p, I got on the first flight for the NYC.  Having to pay a slight fee to allow for this, I learned at check that I was bumped up to business class – how brilliant – it reminds me of flights from London and Paris in trips gone by. When finally boarding, I was further delighted to learn that I had been upgraded again to First Class from Business. J Let me tell you – First Class is hard living. I’m about to down my third glass of champagne and consume a cheese plate prepared especially for me since the vegetarian meal was not available.  I think that after I blog and eat and work on my final, I might watch some Curb Your Enthusiasm as I know for a fact that I have that DVD in said laptop at the moment – what I am not sure, however, is whether I have my cd envelopes with about 15 other DVDs for my viewing pleasure. My only complaint is that the power outlet in my chair seems to cutout every 5minutes…so tough this First Class livin’.  Maybe later I will continue this blog to talk about my holiday…it includes but is not limited to the following: drug smuggling, French cars, industrial gods, gothic fags, German National Socialists, Hammerskins, miles of pavement, litres of petrol, millions of bugs and a black cat.  Ciao!  Someone near me is watching that Broken Glass movie with Hayden Christensen – HC is the Ryan Phillippe of the early 2000’s but without the hot wife. I don’t know what Lucas sees in this momo.  And the flight has been a bit on the turbulent side. And I’ve switched from champagne to Sprite – much more refreshing. I’ve already had the chance to load my pictures into this computer – some keepers, some real losers. I’ll share those at a later date. Now I have to try to finish my final so that I don’t have to worry about it once again on terraferma.  Well this flight continues to be turbulent – making me honestly nervous – and I never get nervous on flights. Let me use this opportunity to report on the musical aspect of my trip – M’ERA LUNA.  What started as a one day festival, M’ERA LUNA has ended up being one of the surviving German events bringing in over 25,000 visitors to a beautiful little town that is pretty much over run with jerks in full clad black outfits in middle of the summer. This is something I will never understand. I don’t care who you think you are or how embedded in the “scene” you think you are – there is no reason to dress head to toe in black, whether it’s cotton or polyester or PVC or leather – it’s just stupid. And the other thing I don’t understand is why these people who love their snow white tans don’t enlist the services of sunblock. I witnessed some of the most horrific tan lines on Saturday that I was in shock. These kids don’t make any sense to me. When the Douche and I were exposed to the “tanned-goth” of the Doomsday 2000 festival – that, too, didn’t make sense to me until this weekend: M’ERA LUNA 2000 was a week before the Doomsday fest we went to, so by the time we saw them, their terrible burns had turned tan. Just sayin’.  So the music. The Jax and I drove from Munich to Hildesheim with much ease and settled into our hostel only long enough to freshen up and hit the festival. Complaint number 1 – when you are charging 45 euros at the door for a single day ticket – ACCEPT CREDIT CARDS YOU FUCK! Or at least accept cards inside at the official t-shirt stands or have an ATM inside or something!!! After that setback and the realization that our purchasing power had greatly diminished even before entering the venue (an old airport), we wandered over to the main stage for the what was the second song of goth-rocker legend Wayne Hussey and The Mission. The band does not fit the man. I’m probably all wet on this but the guitarist looks a lot like Danny Lohner of NIN fame. The open-air affect was not nice to these guys. They put on a good performance considering the heat and the daylight and the stupid crowd. Following The Mission was L’Ame Immortelle – a band enjoyed by the Jax and a band I was interested in checking out because of the hype surrounding them and boy was I not disappointed – they sucked even worse than I had anticipated, though the crowd seemed to enjoy them greatly – see where I’m going here? This 6 piece included a drummer, guitarist, bassist, keyboardist, female vocalist and male vocalist who doubled as cheerleader and occasionally hit a key or two. These cats were weak. Even the Jax was like asking if I felt like making a 4+ mile roundtrip walk to the nearest ATM rather than watch these guys. Pathetic.  We next ventured over to “the hangar” in great anticipation of Fixmer/McCarthy. We headed over a little early and ended up catching the end of In Strict Confidence’s set. I’m not positive, but I think there was another industrial band from LI called ISC, but this is not the same band. This four piece, including a female vocalist for one song, owned the hangar. Their music was a bit simplistic, but was catchy. The lead singer reminded me of Ash if he were a bit more assertive and could sing in a deep German voice. After leaving the stage at promptly the moment they were supposed to (these Germans are proficient at some things) about 70% of the packed hangar left. We made our way to pretty close to the stage and I was beaming with anticipation. Then all of the Nitzer Ebb shirts started filing in. Everyone was ready for something special. Terrance Fixmer, some techno guy, came out and did his own soundcheck only to retreat back behind a curtain for another five minutes before showtime. Truth be told I was not a big fan of this album – but that wasn’t stopping me from strapping on my messenger bag as close to me as possible in case I had to remind the Germans why we won WWII. So Fixmer comes back out and gets some sort of beat going…DUH DUH DUH DUH and the germans are going nuts b/c that’s something they can dance to. Then Douglas McCarthy comes out – aviator Ray Ban shades, close buzz haircut, dark blue Levis (hanging a bit low though), black shoes and a dark blue button down with the sleeves rolled up – and shouts “REMEMBER ME?!?!?!” This man knows that everyone is there not because of his new project but because of who HE is/was – and he didn’t make us wait a single second and Fixmer’s beat/ambient tune turned into the main bassline and drum tracks from “Join in the Chant”. I instantly handed the Jax my camera (What do you call a girl at a hard core show? Coat rack.), then first I said “I’m going to cry” and quickly followed it with “I’m going to go elbow some Germans in the face”. Less than 5seconds later I found myself 3feet from the barricade in the dead center of the stage. All I can say is that McCarthy has been doing this for about 20years and his voice is still like is on the So Bright, So Strong e.p. Other NE songs included Murderous, Control, I’m Here and Let Your Body Learn (as the encore). My only slight complaint is that the old NE songs(except for JItC) were a bit more big 4/4 beat as opposed to the originals and also he tended to leave out verses settling for the big payoff of the bridges and choruses – I guess best delivered over the big beat. I was disappointed in that but I do understand why it was done the way it was, but like DM bringing back Black Celebration for the last (?) tour – it’s just plain not as good.  Aside from having a wound on my elbow reopened by some faeg’s spike (causing blood to pour from my arm), I was thoroughly entertained and look forward to seeing them in the States – maybe Cesar can book it.  Looking at the interactive flight map I can see we are over Québec now – only an hour + outside of Newark – it’s a wonderful feeling entering your own timezone again. Returning to work tomorrow is going to be a giant nightmare but I guess it’s what one has to do in order to take these adventures.  Enough philosophizing – back to my homework for the remaining hour. Tchüess!!! (Brandt can correct my spelling)          "
2948997,female,Student,"       Can someone tell me how we got to be like this?  As I sit at my desk at work trying to assist a person, others decide that they are more important and barge into the converstation which is none of their business. The reason: Because they do not want to wait their turn.  How about when I am shopping in the grocery store and women push me out of their way because there is a sale on beef for .90 cents per pound (don't these people know it's bad to eat meat and even worse to be rude?)   What about the school hallways where I am always shoved out of the way. Have we not heard of muttering a phrase...something like...excuse me?  Our society is so violence, in such a rush and so complusively careless. We don't care about the person beside you because it's simply not you. Its the whole idea of you being the most important person in the world...I believe you need to value yourself, but not at the cost of degrading a person to make yourself feel better. Girls are the worst for this. I speak from person experience, we are catty creatures that thrive on the kill...a savage instinct that is imbred in all of us along with the desire to spite and the motivation to hurt.   If anyone realized the potential girls have to be lethal weapons, nuclear war would not be the popular method of killing a group of people. I figure, you could just send in a population of females who would degrade you, this is worse than capital punishment because with c.p at least you know you are going to die. Not with girls, they attack you using your weaknesses, and they know exactly which ones are the ones that will cause the biggest reaction.   We are compulsively careless, we spend money at every turn and are unaware of people's feelings and thoughts.   We are a rude thoughtless society full of rage, hate and blood...and nuclear women.   I do not like people...I feel that everyone is only out for themselves...show me a normal person who does things for the sole purpose of kindness and I will point out their humanist flaw...their hope.  What is a cynic? A man who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing.    "

766556,female,indUnk,"        What are they thinking?  There are 2 new advertising campaigns out right now that, if nothing else, have at least caught my attention.    First of all, there's the new Guess? girl.  At least I think she's new.  I see her every morning on my way to work, on a bus stop ad.  Have you seen this?  She sort of looks like Claudia Schiffer, very Bridgette Bardot-ish; only she's more like the white-trash trailer park version.  I'm not sure what's going on with this one - maybe it's Claudia all washed out and used up?  Is she hard pressed for money or something?  I don't understand.  Maybe Guess? is trying to reach the low income denim wearers of America?  Then there's the new 'Pork, the other white meat' campaign.  Which, now that I see these two together, sort of goes with the trailer park girl. But, I digress.  Familiar quotes and phrases have been twisted to serve pork's purpose.  There's 'Go ahead, make my pork' and 'Time flies when you're having pork'.  It's clever I suppose.  Not really very creative, but catchy.    There's only one problem for me with this.  I have a friend with a very colorful vocabulary and he already uses pork as a replacement for another very colorful word.  You, uh, change the p-o-r to f-u-c and, well... you get the picture.  So, when I read 'Time flies when you're having pork' I'm thinking, 'Yeah. It sure does.  And I could use a little pork right now!' *blush*  Diva out.          "
883178,male,Fashion,"            Gotta Get Me Some Kids   Friends, yesterday I had the opportunity to do a Public Education-type thing with the fire department.  We went to a school out in Woodbury and got to talk with little kindergarteners about firefighters, trucks, etc.  I probably looked like a smiling buffoon because I really, in all seriousness, think little kids are the funniest creatures walking the planet.  They sat 'on their pockets' (a new term for indian-style sitting) and looked up at the other guys and I like we were superheroes.  That alone, has been worth all the work and stuff I've done to become a legit fireman.   Some highlights:   - When asked if they had any questions, 10-12 little hands shot up.  'How hot does in get in those fires?' 'My grandma had surgery on her knee last month.' 'One time my dad was driving and he saw smoke coming from his car.' 'Do you catch bad guys?'   - When brought outside to have a look inside our fire truck:  'I've never been in a fire truck before!'   Yeah?  I said.  What do you think?   'It's good.'   'Aren't we going to drive around and put out fires?' 'I want to climb the ladder.'   (note: the ladder is 75 feet straight up in the air)  As I helped the kids down from the truck, I told them to be careful because it was slippery.  As I led the group of 5 kids back toward the school, I noticed a little hand had grabbed mine.  I looked down and this little girl was holding my hand.  Awww....  I could go on, but I'm sure you get the idea: I can't wait to have kids.  Side note: I should be getting some pictures of the event soon.  I'll be sure to share them, yo.         "
3568056,male,Sports-Recreation,"           its been a while (2 whole days) since the last post, so this might be a bit long, we shall see.  yesterday, i played 27 holes of golf.  i sucked up the first 9, but then i came back w/ a 39 on the back, so i went an extra 9 holes to try to break 80 (an elusive goal that has consumed my golfing life since i broke 90).  i started off fine, but i had 2 straight 3-putts and a lost ball, which killed me, so i ended up with 39-44 83, which is my best for this season as of yet.  i was happy enough, but i know i blew it.  that just gives me something to push for this summer i guess. last night i saw dodgeball with a bunch of friends.  i got there late, so we had to sit in the aisle.  then some usher kicked us out bc it was a 'fire hazard'.  we got back in, but we had to split up.  i ended up next to some guy in the 2nd row.  there were some interesting parts, i will say that (the pizza thing, ick), but it was funny for the most part.  it could have been better, but it fulfilled its purpose of mindless entertainment imo.  we went out for sushi after that.  i dont really like sushi, but it was fun. this morning i played golf w/ my dad, my pastor, and another guy from church.  they wouldnt play for money (6-6-6 $5 nassau), which is unfortunate bc i won every 6 w/ my partner (we played for 'bragging rights', which last time i checked wont help pay for tuition).  nobody, including myself, played particularly well, but we had a good time.  after that, i went to gregs grad party at 'the barn' in westerville.  its a pretty cool place, i wouldnt mind having mine there. so there is my activity list of the last couple days.  after the party i sat at home and watched the us open.  did anybody else see the 7 green?  i have only played 1 green like that, and it is completely unfair (i 5-putted it in a tournament, it kept rolling backwards 20+ feet).  that shouldnt happen in a professional tournament.  however, everyone played the same unfair green, so in a roundabout way it was fairish.  i am pulling for phil, but i dont have anything against anybody near the top.  it should be fun to watch.

3749504,female,Student,"       Have I bitched yet about how much I hate phones? I do. I was trying to get ahold of Chelsea, to ask if she wants to go to a movie tonight. Well, a while ago her family decided to get rid of their landline and switched to having only cell phones. So from previous experience, I know the number in the phone book is “out of order.” She gave me her new numbers but, idiot that I am, I lost them. So I looked up Ashley’s phone number (it’s crazy, I have absolutely none of my friend’s phone numbers written down) but it’s not in any phone book. So I look up Roxie’s number and call her. Answering machine. She never picks up because she has caller ID and my number doesn’t show up, so she thinks it’s a telemarketer. I hate leaving messages, so I don’t. And I call Jayne. She doesn’t have Chelsea’s, but she has Ash’s. So I call the number she gives me – and I get an answering machine that says this is the home of the “Bobs” or something like that. I didn’t catch it, but I was pretty sure it wasn’t “Bernard” he said. So I call Alysia. Doesn’t have Chelsea’s number, but has Ashley’s. Guess what, it’s the same one Jayne gave me! So I call the number back, and it’s busy. I call about four more times until she picks up and gives me Chelsea’s number…  And nobody answers.  I hate phones.  But today’s experience inspired me to look up/find every single one of my friend’s numbers and print them out to hang on my bulletin board. Everyone’s but Dorene’s, Amy’s and Molly’s, because I probably will never need to call them and besides, Amy is staying in Seattle all summer.  Sorry to bore you with this inconsistent crap…but, if you haven’t noticed, my life is made out of inconsistent crap. I wish I was wittier and could make the whole thing a big joke, but I’m afraid it already is (?). My mother forgot to call Aunt Tonia so if we do go to Ashland, it won’t be for another few days.

4192173,male,Technology,"             Well the guest stars SHINED last night, even though Ash forced us to record in the dark.   Ash, of course, comes armed to the hilt with gear and Robin shows up being Robin, so you know it's going to be a fun evening. My only demand as 'boss' is that we lay down Robin's fingerpicking piece that I have been in love with. Other than that, it's free reign for anyone to do whatever they want. Ash JUMPS for the bass guitar. I'm not kidding when I say JUMP.  So you put all these rockers in a room and what do you get? Soundtrack music!! moody, atmospheric soundtrack music.  We wrote two songs, both of which sound like music for film, something I have been aching to do for sometime, but never really pursued. Ash's current obession is the bass guitar and his attention to it SHOWS, as he lends a unique rythmn to the material, which leaves me free to indulge in my Peter Hook fantasies, but at a new and subdued level. Robin is a master of the acoustic. Her fingerpicking piece, now titled 'They've Just...', is excellent. Brandt and I stared at each other a few times, knowing that we had something, new, special, different and excellent to add to HF2. When Ash is telling me to record strings, you know we're on a roll. I forgot how fun it was to sit in a room with a bunch of friends and just create music. And it helps that the music is amazing!  Hopefully, this will be JUST the first round with these two...  Chemlab artwork is rolling in and is MASSIVE. Like an idiot I first hated the cover image, wrote Jared to say so, and then an hour later I was in love with it and feeling like an idiot. Anyway, it fits the album perfectly and the guy doing this, Mike, at Burnlab is solid. The contributor to this album and the fan in me both now want this album DONE so I can just hold it and play it for my friends.

But... &nbsp; I forget what my point is.&nbsp; Let's move on. &nbsp; I&nbsp;have been watching lots of movies this&nbsp;week (it's only Thursday), going after work (because I get off early enough to catch matinees).&nbsp; So far this week I've seen Anchorman, Saved! and today I saw Before Sunset.&nbsp; I&nbsp;realized that my whole movie kick is because I'm feeling down. &nbsp; I dunno.&nbsp; I've been super-tired since&nbsp;this week started.&nbsp; Like all the hectic Hyphen stuff is over, my dad arrived in Japan on Sunday night--there's nothing more for me to really focus&nbsp;all my energy on anymore, for me to avoid feeling sad again about my mom.&nbsp; I know I'm depressed when I eat shitty foods and all I want to do is sleep (or my sleeping habits&nbsp;change--I've been falling asleep at 10:30 PM the past few nights,&nbsp;and waking up at 2 or 3 AM, then going back to sleep til abouta 7 AM) or shop. &nbsp; Anyhow.&nbsp; It'll surpass, I know.&nbsp; Just takes time... &nbsp; I feel&nbsp;a strange tickle in my throat, indicating the onset of a cold.&nbsp; You know that feeling, when it hurts to swallow?&nbsp; Sometimes I think thats worse than actually having a cold.  &nbsp;  Anyhow.&nbsp; Some retard tried to talk to me at the Barnes &amp; Noble in Colma yesterday.&nbsp; I was walking around the magazine section, trying to find Fast Company, and lo and behold an IT-looking white guy (you know what Im talking about) locks me on his Pinay Radar.&nbsp;  Why does it always have to be skanky, greasy-haired, IT-looking white guys who like Filipinas?&nbsp;  WHY?    &nbsp;  Acting cool and oblivious, I took my stack of magazines and sat down in Starbucks with an iced soy mocha.&nbsp; The guy sat down at an empty table across from me and struck up a conversation.&nbsp; The guy mentioned something about how hes totally into CHRIS ISAAK.&nbsp; How he used to be an avid watcher of The Chris Isaak Show on HBO, how Chris Isaak is considered geeky because hes misunderstood and people only remember that video he did with Helena Christensen.&nbsp; I wasnt sure if I was being testedwas this guy being for real?&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I didnt want to find out.&nbsp; I was like, Peace out, dude.&nbsp; I was outta there with the quickness.  &nbsp;  HOW is it that the guys who try to talk to me are always dorky, desperate, socially inept white IT-looking guys?&nbsp; Oh, and lets not forget homelesshomeless men love harassing me.&nbsp; One time on Haight Street, I walked by this homeless guy who was like, Come on baby, Ill show you a good time.&nbsp; He made these air-humping gestures, flicking his tongue out in that lascivious (I wanna eat you out) sort of way, chanting, Pussy!&nbsp; Pussy!&nbsp; Ugh.  &nbsp;  So back to my pining: Why cant the guys I find attractive be attracted to me?&nbsp; Why cant I get chatted up by guys who have all their teeth, who dont look like greasy IT guys with Filipina fetishes, or guys who look like a crackhead/pimp character from a Dave Chapelle skit?&nbsp; Why are the guys I like not interested in me, only want to be my friend, already attached, or gay?&nbsp; Ive been asking myself these questions for 25 years now.  &nbsp;  About nine months ago I was talking to this guy from Virginia who I met really randomly (translation: online/Friendster).&nbsp; He was totally different than mehe listened to mainstream alternative (think Hoobastank and Incubus) and worked for some tech company based in SF that always had him out in the field (Dallas for two weeks, London for one week, etc., etc.).&nbsp; He was a Good Southern Boy who was in a frat in collegea frat where he had lots of Filipino pledge brothers, and so he developed a thing for hot, petite Pinay girls.&nbsp; He would tell me, in mangled Tagalog,  Maganda ka /Youre pretty.  Can you say GROSS!?  &nbsp;  Ben (that was his name) tried to sway me to be more understanding; accused me of being REVERSE RACIST.&nbsp; I was like, First of all, you cant talk race or racism with methats what my whole college experience was about.&nbsp; And second of all, Im not racist, Im CAUTIOUS.&nbsp; I mean, if you were me and some white guy found out what ethnicity you were, then reacted like, Oh my God, youre Filipina?&nbsp; Filipinas are totally HOT! wouldnt you be freaked out, too?&nbsp; I mean, could you be more obvious about being excited to dabble in Otherness?&nbsp; I want someone to like me because they like ME and not my Filipino-ness.&nbsp; (I should mention that it didnt help when Ben admitted to me, after I asked him if hed ever dated any Asian/Filipina girls, that he hadnt because theyd all prefer to be his friend.&nbsp; Gee, I wonder why.)  &nbsp;  Where oh where is a cute, smart, ambitious, hip, self-deprecating Asian or hapa guy for moi?&nbsp; Someone who finds my neuroses amusing?&nbsp; Someone who can hold his own when introduced to my crazy family (that sounds so  My Big Fat Greek Wedding , I know)?&nbsp; Huh?&nbsp; I want cute little Asian babies, like the one Angelina Jolie adopted.&nbsp; Can I specifically ask for Asian sperm if I opt for artificial insemination because nobody likes me?&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Sometimes I fear that Im doomed to be single the rest of my life.&nbsp; (Thats not necessarily a bad thing, I knowall my aunties think if I end up single its because Im some career-minded Type A bitch.)&nbsp; For Valentines Day next year, while all my friends are out on dates, Im going to have to go to that one gay male strip club my friend told me about where you can grab on The D for $30 admission.&nbsp; I think its called Knob Hill or its in Nob Hill, or something like that.&nbsp; &nbsp;  Okay, Im totally babbling right now.&nbsp; I've been writing so much lately; I need to stop. &nbsp; Sigh.

3644456,male,indUnk,"       Well, it's baseball's all star break, and we're 86 games through the season.  The Sox stand at a decent 48-38 clip, a game ahead of the wild card over Oakland and 7 games behind the Yankees, who I still think arn't that good.   Who would have guessed that the Sox AND Cubs would be 7 games behind in their perspective divisions?  These teams have so much talent before the season, that's like saying that Jimmy Fallon AND Nicole Richie will get Oscars by the end of the decade.  I was at the game yesterday, still pretty bummed how they lost.  Those umpires SUCKED, they had a major case of, 'We want to go home-itis'.    At least my DAG % (Drunkness At Games percentage) is still at 1.000.  Jesus HAS reincarnated himself as Johnny Damon (for now).  I mean, look at the similaries!  The hair, the closeness of the initals (JC, JD), and the many miracle plays over the past 8 games.  Now if he can only turn the warm Bud Light drafts at games into GOOD beer.......  Roger Clemens to the Red Sox, right?  Sounds good and look good right?  *SMACK*!  It's never going to happen......  Randy Johnson MIGHT still go to NY.......but odds are he'll go to Anaheim (if they play well in the next 12 games).  The Red Sox in my baseball season on EA's MVP BASEBALL 2004 are 60-26.  I'm the man, and so is Nomar, who in my season, is hitting .354 with 34 HRs and 70 RBI with a .400 OBP.  Barry Bonds is hitting .415!  NCAA Football 2005 comes out July 15th.  Madden 2005 comes out 2 weeks later.  Two MORE reasons why I don't need a girlfriend........  Sitting in the bleachers yesterday drunk off my ass looking at cute girls in skimpy Red Sox clothing the ONLY reason to have a girlfriend......  Shaq to the Heat?  That's OK, ain't like the Celtics are going to win the division for the next 10 years, anyways.  A show at the Cantab Lounge today on 738 Mass Ave near Central Sq on the Red Line.

Plus, Zach is on vacation, so he hasn't e-mailed me lately. I miss him immensely.  It's hard to find good people online that you can talk to. I certainly haven't in years, if you don't count Dane, who isn't fun to talk to anyways, and I just put up with him because we go to the same school.  So I want to make some 'new friends' to chat with, because I'm pretty lonely when I'm online now.

4013263,female,Automotive,"                  I have four cats because.... I am insane?&nbsp; no.... Because I wanted them? partially.&nbsp; Ok here is the story.&nbsp; I have 4 cats because of one cat and a boyfriend who don't get along.&nbsp; Somehow along the way, my precious Winter became terrified of my boyfriend, Brian, after we moved in together.&nbsp; He started shitting in places he wasn't suppose to as well as peeing. It got in his fur, in my closet etc. It made my life hell for 3 months. I had to lock Winter up in a cage.&nbsp; Me and Brian moved into a 2 bedroom apartment in February. Winter got his own room. Winter was still terrified and doing all those bad things even though he could hear Brian but couldn't see him.&nbsp; So, I thought that getting another cat would help.&nbsp; Well, I couldn't find a place who would not call my Landlord about having another cat. So I went to the vet and they were selling 2 cats for the price of one. They were littermates and just under a year old.&nbsp; I took them because I wanted something and if this is all I could get, I would take it.&nbsp;    Winter got immediately better.&nbsp; Brian's attitude towards cats improved by 100%.&nbsp; Then a few months later, I got an email from a friend saying he knew someone who wanted to get rid of their black persian.&nbsp; I couldn't resist since a black persian was my dream cat.&nbsp; Now I have Winter, Midnight, Jasmine and Jayma.&nbsp; My least favorite is Jayma because she beats up the cats to the point where she is vicious. She breaks things and shreds on things. She begs for food all the time.&nbsp; She is annoying. I wouldn't mind getting rid of her.&nbsp; The two kittens are compulsive over eaters.&nbsp; They eat so much that I had to have set feeding times for them. When they don't have food to eat, they like to eat things that are not food and they chew on wires.&nbsp; It is annoying. They are extremely obese. My two persians, Winter and Midnight, are so precious. They play together and have fun. They are so beautiful that it takes my breath away. I really love those two cats alot.&nbsp; I would be torn up if anything ever happend to them.    So that is the story of why I have 4 cats instead of just two.&nbsp;          "

I know a symphony will have four movements; I know sonata form is often fast-slow-fast; I know many pop songs have two verses, two choruses, and a bridge; I know James Bond will win; I know the meal will end with dessert; I know people in romantic comedies fall in love, despite the obstacles in the way.

4305651,male,Student,"   i seem to have signed up for a blog. my intention was to post a comment after seeing my name used in some kind of article on a blog entitled http://dontyouhatepants.blogspot.com.. i know now it was written by an old friend named nicholas 'zach morris' mcdowell, but at first glance (from a link on the schroek blog) i thought i was being fooled by some kind of cookie-manipulating, sarcasm-generating cyborg joke site. i seem to have been half right. anyway, i might as well tell you about my week and mention that if you visit the 'hate pants' site you'll see i made some comment about cowing out. cowing out? i've never known a soul who would  store such a phrase in their vocabulary. i felt i needed to respond and now i've got a fucking blog. i do however use the word 'anywho.'  my week.  anywho last saturday was a trip to one of the half dozen fabulous cinemas on houston st, the sunshine, for a first-time viewing of the princess bride. i went with max oglesbee, his sister phoebe (13 yo), and her friend abby. they were practically hyperventilating at the midnight showing of one of their favorite movies, and it was as fun to watch them as it was to watch the movie itself. we met tara lorenzen for a brief minute before the movie. she was at the sidewalk cafe on avenue a (gorgeous phrase right?) and carried her beer out with her in her purse. tara and i went into the ace bar on 5th street, watched pat moynihan botch a game of pool, introduced tara to rob, then walked her to the train and went to see the movie. highlight of the evening was the after-film piss with max, where my comment on mark knopfler's soundtrack got a surprising chuckle out of the urinal between us, a man who later commented that the rainbow colored rainboots we used to sneak beer into the movie theatre were 'the kind of shit i'm talking about!' whatever-in-the-living fuck that meant. seriously, that hombre was 'cowed out.'  sunday i worked at my part-time 2-day a week for a free membership job at the 92nd street Y. its a cultural center more than a gym, and you can learn more about it at http://www.92ndsty.org.   monday i was invited by a dear friend mr. josh peskowitz to a fader magazine/cornerstone party at a gallery space on 18th street betwixt 9th and 10th. free beers provided by red stripe and harp, a free show of ted leo/the pharmacists and the libertines. the libertines were great looking, and ted leo was great sounding. at least to me. i'm not sure if max o. and jersey walz, my friends in attendance, enjoyed, but i certainly did. a vague head-nod and hello to a mr. james iha, in attendance; who ten years ago would have made me crawl across the floor to gush unscripted professions of adoration. nice to see he's still... turning japanese. i really think so. the after party at the maritime hotel was more of a before party. max and i left before it seemed to really get off the ground.  tuesday i was at the gym again and at the evening took a phone call from danielle florio to hear about the last phish show. despite not being a fan, i was enthralled at the experiences she encountered and couldn't help the mild pangs of jealousy i felt at missing what seemed a pretty historic event. slept well for the first time in all of august i think, drifting to sleep with images of vermont dancing vicariously through my head.  wednesday at the libraries all day, researching and editing an old piece of nonfiction. et ceteras...  thursday i had lunch with jersey walz, a brief stop at her father's lawyer's apartment on 72nd and central park west. had her homemade granola for the first time since the day she left for italy last summer. with rice milk. i gave her 12 blues songs on a cd-r, and she gave me a bag of granola to go. saw her new portrait camera ( a knockout ), some of her mother's antartica photos, and then hailed her a cab outside the building on the way to port authority. workers were tearing up the sidewalk out in front of the dakota, where 24 years ago john lennon was shot. i'm sure its been replaced several times since, but i had to wonder. rode with her bags and waited with her till she got on her bus to boston. she's staying at kurt vonnegut's house in barnstable mass this week, and will probably have some extraordinary photographs of the author and the ocean when she returns. you'd think in such a situation a man who pretends to be mildly intellectual could've figured out a way to get hisself invited along, but i was too stunned to even think of it.   and then afterwards i went to r.a.w. cuts barber shop next door to my building for a haircut. only white face in the premises. normally i can get by in these kinds of situations; talk hip-hop, talk jazz, talk r&b, talk movies. these particular guys just weren't havin' it. listened to my barber anthony tell me about the finer points of black pussy, asian women, and the barbershop basketball league. my big white irish face reflected off two mirrors, and a deep sadness that i could not, after all, 'hang.' but after the cut (45 minute cut for $12 bones, unbelievable), they invited me back to chill out front and have some beers. anthony's brother stanley told one of the best stories i've ever heard. one of those classics where nothing really happens, and its all in the telling (and unlike this one you're reading), but damn!  friday was a gem. worked the Y in the morning, tutored a 4th grader in math in the bronx after lunch, a college student in queens (requiring a 1.75 hour train ride through brooklyn to richmond hill), and then back to another student's on the lower east side. in all, four boroughs before dinner. danielle florio took the train in from westchester and met me on 125th street. i showed her my new harlem apartment, which she loved more than i ever will. we had a beer in the living room and then dined at the quintessential soul food restaurant, charles' southern fried chicken on 152nd and 8th avenue. the world's best fried chicken, in case you were wondering. the ribs, collards, sweet potatoes, and pulled pork are also in the world's top ten. took a stroll through one of my favorite neighborhoods in all of new york, the well-preserved and oft-overlooked hamilton heights. i love taking people over there and talking my usual over-factual conversation through these near-silent, immaculate streets. its about convent avenue from 145th to 135th, with a stroll down hamilton terrace at 143rd to see the house used by wes anderson in the royal tenenbaums. at 141st the preserved former house of alexander hamilton, where he lived from 1802-04, when he was killed in a duel in... of all places...hoboken.... saw a sign across from hamilton's crib stating 'apartments $1000-1600,' prompting me to speculate ways to get out of my lease.  and so we're only at 10pm on friday. waited at the D train stop on 125th, at a popeyes, for danielle's new boyfriend peter atlas. a very sweet and overwhelmingly laid back cat from middletown ny, who accompanied us back to my place while i took a shower. while i was in the shower, six gunshots rang out from a guy going by on a motorcycle. i didn't hear it at all, but the hip couple in my living room swore it was true. lenox ave was shut down right outside my window, and our ride to the evening's party was mildly rerouted.  the evening's party was at the yankee ferry, a boat parked on pier 23 in tribeca, at the end of north moore st. to be brief, which i haven't been, its a boat owned by a friend of a friend. a 1909 former staten island ferry, its the only boat in manhattan you can live on, and since the owners were gone for the weekend, max o. was in charge. which meant a very rare opportunity for a small gathering on the upper deck, surrounded by the financial district, the holland tunnel ventilation towers, abandoned piers, and the warehouses of tribeca. out in the hudson, a gorgeous, humid evening, with a collective of great folks celebrating morgan whirledge's 21st birthday. a well-timed joint created a blur of wildly nonsensical topics of conversation, one of them being the heaven better than the heaven from stairway to heaven. I know you're thinking 'stairway to better heaven,' but actually we preferred to call it 'stairway to uber-heaven.' max described this particular heaven in these quotes below, which i scrawled on an atm receipt in my pocket and deciphered this morning.  'stairway to uber-heaven, the eiffel 94 supersonic master plan! the relative major of the tonic brigade! did i say tunnel bridge? you can't have a tunnel that's a bridge, that's impossible.'  after this, we calmed down slightly, and max told morgan and i another one of the best stories i've ever heard: the entire history of the yankee ferry. it included trips through both world wars, decades-long tours as a staten and block island ferry, and its last ten years as a historical landmark and a controversial eyesore in the new york harbor. a completely fascinating story, including how the boat got its water, electricity, and its docking privileges. it wouldn't be worth mentioning at all if it wasn't in constant threat of sinking or being removed from the pier by the ny/nj port authority.   on the pier at around three (vagueness starting to settle in), we took off from the boat and ran through the sand of the beach volleyball courts on the adjoining pier. soft sand between the toes is a luxury rarely known by the city resident, while the drunk city resident ponders the beauty of lying down in it and never getting up again.  and so that brings me to tonight. just returned from a relaxing evening spent at a party in the building on the fourth floor. played three vicious games of spades at the card table in the kitchen, where despite a rusty start, finished the last two games with my teammate julio in the victory collumn. the last game went to a third tie-breaker, all bets wagered, a crowd of onlookers and four spades left in my hand for the final rounds. won the last two hands for a meager ten points victory. risked it all and came out huge. could have spent the evening hitting on the pretty peruvian girl celia who came into my apartment hours before looking for one of my roommates, and instead i played cards with a harlem local, a brooklyn native, and a spaniard. and a white boy from upstate new york who has a lot more game with a stack of cards then with the ladies.   so that's my week. i wanted to post it and then maybe someday i can come back to it and seen what i did mid-august of 2004. i'm not much into the blogging thing. the reason the post is so long is because well, i can see this being the one and only post of this site. i've had better weeks and plan to have better ones still, but its nice every once in a while to capture this shit and have it the way it was when i remembered it freshly, and not out of some haze of a few years on. who knows. hope you enjoyed.

766556,female,indUnk,"        Something to Ponder  From  urlLink Friday Five :  1. What was your biggest accomplishment this year? Toss up between getting into my own apartment in January and getting child support.  2. What was your biggest disappointment? DBD losing his job after only 3 months, thereby losing my child support.  3. Will you be making any New Year's resolutions?  Yes - to create stronger bonds with the people I know & love.  4. Where will you be at midnight? Do you wish you could be somewhere else?  Working at my hotel, standing on Miami Beach watching fireworks with glass of champagne in hand - and I get paid to do this!  5. Aside from (possibly) staying up late, do you have any other New Year's traditions?  I just believe that whatever you are doing on NYE sets the theme for the new year.  And for my own thoughts, not ones borrowed from  urlLink Eliz     Things I've learned this year.  1. How to get the child support & judicial system to work without the aid (?) of a lawyer. 2.

3705830,male,Non-Profit,"       an interesting weekend.  no, let me put it differently. a great weekend. an outstanding weekend. made so by the presence of a certain scouser that has been decidedly missing from my life of late. whilst the reunion wasn't everything i'd hoped for, i do concede that sometimes clothes  are  necessary...  a trip to liverpool brings back many memories, all of them good, and adds many more besides. promises to go again soon are much less than idle, i assure you. returning to manchester on saturday with alex in hand, so to speak, we are able to catch up on months of pointless chattering, which is always good. having to fulfil a promise i made a long time ago (under duress, i'm sure), i dug out the magic box and did some tricks; the reaction i got makes me wonder why i ever gave it up. well, maybe i didn't, really. just a change of emphasis. i couldn't help but be amused that the patter was all still there in my head; maybe my childhood wasn't so wasted after all. some of the shows we did! completely daft, but they've got to be some of my favourite times. those days we were indestructible; we could do anything, so we did. not such a bad way of living.  they say that you can have too much of a good thing, and the takeaway pizza almost had the better of me, but i outwitted it in the end. with the intention of getting horrendously drunk we then proceeded to get dressed for the night out; i put some shoes on, whilst maria and alex proceeded to try everything on twice, straighten their hair (i idly did a bit of my fringe but succeeded only in looking like i was from  urlLink franz ferdinand ), put contact lenses in, and lord knows what else (i wasn't allowed in the room, no matter how nicely i asked). turns out that the two of them are exactly the same size in clothes, which is both convenient and a little worrying. apparently they got ready in remarkably quick time. apparently.  any concerns i had about it getting too late for us to become entirely inebriated were soon put to rest with our arrival at  urlLink kro bar , where we swiftly ordered the strawberry beer we'd been looking forward to. finding ceri and some assorted chemists also at the bar was a bonus, and with the addition of gargantuan paul made a decent eight. and there we stayed until closing, whereupon we sauntered to the inestimably groovy big hands. ceri's admirable figure and sharp eyes getting us entry discount and a table respectively, it all worked out very well indeed. as we proceeded to drink and shoot the distinct lack of breeze, and on the promise of some frankly lewd behaviour (yet to materialise; i should have got it written down, dammit) i repeated the elastic band trick a couple of times. the principle of never repating a trick can be bent slightly with the addition of alcohol, i find. discussions of kung fu and swaying to the sounds of  urlLink manu chao  give way  to me being told that i am gay 'because i know cat's cradle'. hmmm, and you think they'd be impressed that you could do it with elastic bands. and so, into the night air, and bus rides addressing urgent questions: are we going to bed now, or are we not?  not. instead we are to go to maria's to collect wine (and for paul to steal stella from the fridge, leaving four pounds and the note 'have nicked your stella, buy yourself a palace') and to go 'ssssh!' very loudly, before back to mine to talk about... erm... well anyway, it was good.   sunday morning is true studenthood; a rota system was set up for maria, alex and i to use the shower, the single bowl, and single mug. the idea of simply sharing each one in turn was mooted; but optimism is a good thing, y'know? being thoroughly exhausted and all resting on the single bed together, the look on greg's face when he came to knock on the window was priceless. 'this never happens in my room!' he says, mock-seriously. i feel no compulsion to explain the decidedly less exciting truth of the matter; i just smile and leave the illusion. that's showbiz.  n.

4192173,male,Technology,"             In the wake of the recent rythmn section shake ups in Ass Cobra, which I'm sure is going to lead to some nasty shit amongst the MOGpac, Ash and Robin made their return to the Birdcage last night. Ash was hyper, Robin was not, so I knew they were both in the proper frame of mind to work. On the way down to the studio, I played them the new versions of 1956 and TWOBASSESTHIN. Both were met with enthusiasm. Everyone seems pleased with the direction the album is taking, but we all realize there is still work to be done. Oh yeah, and for the 4,000th time, we listened to Ass Cobra's DETROIT, which has supposedly taken 6 months to do.   I was happy to see B's friend Kid Who Looks Like Kid From Witness All Grown Up in town and chilling. He is quite fey yet handsome and I think because of that he pulls in tons of chicks. I was happy to find he had bought some chocolate donuts. He is quite thin and can live on these things. He watched MR SHOW and realized it wasn't that funny after all...  B and I had an agenda for these two and we put it in effect immediately. The first big decision was to cut almost 3/4 out of SOLAR and start from scratch. No one was happy with the song, so instead of talking about it for hours, we decided to just get rid of everything that was problematic and go at it again. Even I, who normally is adamant about keeping things, felt this made sense. I think the crew were a little surprised how agreeable I was. I'm not sure yet what this means for Link's sax parts, which concerns me a bit  Robin has been playing too much guitar lately, so I felt she needed a bass in her hands. I challenged Ash to stop playing guitar like a jazz half ass and to rock out a little bit. B sat in the corner, I think with a guitar, its hard to tell when Bat-Ash needs the lights off everytime we work. Ash and Robin switched back and forth between bass and guitar and the results were awesome. It took a really long time, which is kinda uncharacteristic for us, but it was worth it as we got the necessary parts to work with. Thanks to these two, we have a good verse and a really nice melodic bridge that (and I didn't say this to Ash at the time) sounds like The Cure.   During all this, I sat with a laptop, checking E-Mail, talking to a few folks online and looking bored . In reality, I'm jotting down ideas for arrangements, occasionally a lyrical idea, and listening VERY closely. Sometimes I'll just spring up and say 'THAT'S IT!' or 'NO NO NO'. Anyway, B will have to lay down his stuff (also quite good) and get all this to me before I leave for LA on Tuesday so I can hammer it into shape. After that, we'll figure out where this tune stands, but I think it's in really good shape.  It was late, but I wanted to flesh out EXIST because I just wasn't happy with the bass in the chorus. And you know its serious when it's ME playing the bassline I don't like it. At this point I was kinda tired, but I recall Robin laying down a lot of bass for me to play with. I also think Ash threw down some guitars.  Overall, it was a evening serious success. It wasn't like our usual sessions where the magic happens immediately. This was more about getting deep into the guts of two songs and mining the gold out of them. It's not easy. Robin referred to is as 'unproductive', though I countered that it's quality, not quantity, and Hypefactor got some real serious quality out of the kids last night.   My immediate task ahead is to work with the new stuff discussed above and to tweak 1956. I have written some lyrics for the song, which are actually the first for this album and now changes need to be made accordingly. In the meantime, the decision has been made to not write any more for this album until we have the live drums over the tracks. When we have that, we will then make the next round of creative decisions. I am hoping we can spend November getting the drums into shape. Then we will assess what we have and then go from there. I'm not putting any time restraints on this one. I want it perfect.  And perfect it shall be...  F           "

Last evening Panda and I walked by a trendy-looking bar at about 5:30pm.  There were a few people inside, baracades at the ready outside, and big promotional posters for a certain heartthrob's new CD by the entrance.  Seems we had stumbled upon a party for Nick Carter (aka a Backstreet Boy and Britney's rumored new squeeze for those not in-the-know).  We flirted with the idea of waiting a few hours for the chance to scream at Nick and his party people as they arrived to celebrate his fantastic new release.  But then we went into a non-trendy bar around the corner and had beers.  I don't regret our choice (yet).  While here, I've been enjoying the HBO provided by my hosts.  I saw the Sopranos (yes, it's great) and it was weird to see it only a day after it originally aired.  I'm used to being way behind on it (and Sex in the City, too) as I catch it on DVD.  More importantly, I've finally seen 'Curb Your Enthusiasm'.  HILARIOUS!  Now I know what Duf has been talking about!!!  More updates to follow.  Congrats, Stoner!!          "

I remember the times us kids spent in the queen-sized bed he shared with Mum, playing 'I Spy with my Little Eye' as he picked out easy items within plain sight, while we picked out items that couldn't possibly be hard to guess, yet he humoured us, and tried multiple times before we laughingly yelled out 'No Pa! It's the TV lah!'  I remember how he used to purse his lips together whenever he got mad, a stern warning to stop being naughty before he brandished the dreaded cane. But I also remember how he restrained from lashing out when he saw my terrible A-level results, and how he tolerated my first serious boyfriend even though he knew that guy was never right for me. And how he embraced the next, now my fiance, into the warm folds of our family.

Boy: The boy thought for a moment and looked intently in her eyes and&nbsp; said, 'You are my rib. In the Bible, it was said that God saw that Adam waslonely, during his sleep; God took one of Adam's rib and created Eve. Every&nbsp; man has been searching for his missing rib, only when you find the woman ofyour life; you'll no longer feel the lingering ache in your heart.'   After their wedding, the couple had a sweet and happy life for a while.However, the youthful couple began to drift apart due to the busy scheduleof life and the never-ending worries of daily problems...Their life became mundane. All the challenges posed by the harshrealities of life began to gnaw away their dreams and love for each&nbsp; other... The couple began to have more quarrels and each quarrel became more&nbsp; heated.   One day, after the quarrel, the girl ran out of the house....&nbsp; At the opposite side of the road, she shouted, 'You don't love me!'&nbsp; The boy hated her childishness and out of impulse, retorted, 'Maybe, it&nbsp; was a mistake for us to be together! You were never my missing rib!'  Suddenly, she turned quiet and stood there for a long while....&nbsp; He regretted what he said but words spoken are like thrown away water,you can never take it back. With tears, she went home to pack her things and was determined in&nbsp; breaking-up.&nbsp;  &nbsp;Before she left the house, 'If I'm really not your missing rib, pleaselet me go.... She continued, 'It is less painful this way... Let us go on&nbsp; our separate ways and search for our own partners...'  Five years went by.... He never remarried but he had tried to find out&nbsp; about her life indirectly......&nbsp; She had left the country and back.... She had married a foreigner and divorced... He felt anguished that she never waited for him. In the dark and lonely&nbsp; night, he lit his cigarette and felt the lingering ache in his heart. He couldn't bring himself to admit that he was missing her.&nbsp;   One day, they finally met.... At the airport, a place where there were many reunions and good-byes... He was going away on a business trip. She was standing there alone, with just the security door separating&nbsp; &nbsp;them.She smiled at him gently.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Boy: How are you? Girl: I'm fine. How about you... Have you found your missing rib?  Boy: No. Girl: I'll be flying to New York in the next flight. Boy: I'll be back in 2 weeks time. Give me a call when you are back...You know my number... Nothing has changed.&nbsp; &nbsp;  With a smile, she turned around and waved 'Good-bye.'  One week later, he heard of her death. She had perished in New York. In&nbsp; the event that shocked the world... Midnight..... Once again, he lit his cigarette...And like before, he felt the lingering ache in his heart...He finally knew, she was the missing rib that he had carelessly broken.   Sometimes, people say things out of moments of fury... Most often than&nbsp; not, the outcome could be disastrous and detrimental....   We vent ourfrustrations 99% at our loved ones... And even though we know that we ought&nbsp; to 'think twice and act wisely', it's often easier said than done.  Things happen each day, many of which are beyond our control. Let us&nbsp; treasure every moment and everyone in our lives.  Tomorrow may never come; give and accept what you have today.&nbsp;   Hope you all treasuring your own Ribs!!!           "

I get a call from Ash telling me he's going into the studio to work on my album and I'm more than welcome to come. Jesus, ok. Thanks for the invite (I mean that in good fun).  As I type, Ash and Brandt are working on guitar parts for our more Cerati sounding track. Ash is giving us those dreamy e-bows that I love and Brandt is....Marring the song up a bit, if you know what I mean. I wanted this to be a rocker, but they are pulling it into a very cool direction.   I, having recorded my bass and guitar parts for this particular tune, get to stare at some wrestling while listening to the lads record. The last time I did something similar, the song 'J-BAR' was written, so I am going with the flow. And the flow is quite good.  An updated version of www.hypefactor.com is up and running. Check it out.  S.O. and I had lunch with the legendary Paris Trout today. Paris is an ace Chicago soundman, road manager and basic jack of all trades. I first met him when he was an engineer on the aggression's FLOOD album, and he has since moved on to be an in-demand soundguy. Whenever he is in town, he makes a call and we hook up for a bite or a drink. I can't tell you how enjoyable his company he is. He's a great guy and I'm always happy to spend time with him. We urged him to get the Year of the Rabbit album, which is out tomorrow, and has been in constant rotation at MOGworld for a few days now. GET IT.  I'm happy to report that PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN does not suck. it's good clean fun. Gore Verbinski, who also directed THE RING, is quickly becoming one of America's best mainstream directors. Hell of a director.  The world of Chemlab is quiet today.   The MOGpac reunion at the German Beerfest this weekend was very enjoyable and it was good to see the entire crew make it out (big ups to The Kidd for making it for a bit despite his bowel problems).

2821801,female,indUnk,"           For those of you who don't know me, I'm a big effing PS2 RPG dork (playstation 2 role-playing game).  My favorite being  urlLink Final Fantasy X  - which I spent about 244 logged hours playing.  You can beat the game (and I did) in about 100 - and I played an additional 144 hours of 'getting extra shit'.   (Which I never did complete I might add)   For instance, just look at all the shit they have over at  urlLink GameFAQs , for FFX.  Jeesus.  In any case, I went out and bought the one true sequel in the Final Fantasy series -  urlLink FFX-2  and O.M.F.G. am I in a world of trouble.  Every time you get one of these games you have to learn a whole new interface, and all the other bullshit that goes along with a new game.  Typically it takes me anywhere between 10 minutes (for most games) to 4-5 hours with the FF series games to get decent at handling the characters and figuring shit out intuitively.   This game is giving me  urlLink aneurisms  .  Not so much from the complexity to do stuff, b/c I think I've got that figured out, but there are literally ENDLESS possibilities as to how you can build your characters up.  My jaw dropped when I finally started getting a feel for how layered the game is going to be.  Keep in mind I've only got about an hour of 'play time' in it.  From what I can tell so far, the game looks pretty badass.  Great graphics, interesting concept (if you played FFX1) and whatever else you could ask for.  The only downside is the 10 second lag between scene changes.  Anyone know if you can get RAM upgrades for PS2's?  Seriously.  I've come to the conclusion that, yes, I really am a dork.   Hah.         "

883178,male,Fashion,"            It's Been a Movie Marathon   I've watched a ridiculous number of movies this week.  Let me separate the good from the bad for you, in case you find yourself in the video store this weekend and don't know what to rent:   urlLink  Secretary  : liked it a lot.  I actually cried a bit at the end even though it was a creepy S&M type love story.  But I think Maggie Gyllenhaal is adorable.   urlLink  Slackers  : good, but not that memorable.  I rented it because of my love for Jason Schwartzman.  He plays a very convincing stalker.   urlLink  Vulgar  : disturbing on so many levels.  Being a Viewaskew production from Kevin Smith, I had high hopes for this film.  Especially with Brian O'Hallaran (Dante from Clerks) as the wacko clown.  If it wasn't for the cameos from Kevin Smith (as a gay TV producer - really funny!) and Jason Mewes (as his slacker-self), I would have turned this off after the first 15 minutes.   urlLink  Pecker  : my favorite of the rentals.  Funny and quirky.  Memama's (the crazy grandma) obsessive idolatry put me over the edge.  She made a Virgin Mary statue talk, using her own voice ('Full of Grace!  Full of Grace!'), and claimed it as a  miracle .  I think even my mom would laugh at that one.   urlLink  Blue Car  : good, but depressing.  Saw this in the theater...I'd call it 'Lolita-lite'.   urlLink  Keeping the Faith  : I was surprisingly delighted by this.  Edward Norton and Ben Stiller make a great combo.  My favorite scene was when Edward Norton's character set himself on fire when using the insense-thingy in church.     urlLink  Rules of Attraction  : funny to see the usually squeaky-clean WB actors turn towards the dark side.  Unsettling, but oddly intriguing.  These kids take debauchery to a whole other level.  Dawson Leary as a drug dealer?  F-ing great.         "

Started around 1pm on Saturday and finished by 5:30pm on Sunday.  Of course, I could never have done it without my friends and family who volunteered to help a Diva out in her time of need.  There were 8 of us in all, the guys moved the heavy furniture and the rest of us girls moved everything else gypsy style - on wheels and in bags, down the elevator to the new apartment.  No packing or unpacking, just move it from one place and put it in its new place.  Everything is in its place, even have the pictures on the walls.  And, while I had to give up the 25th floor view, I must admit that I like my new, closer to the ground view.  I hear the birds singing in the trees in the morning and yesterday I heard church bells.

We basically are glorified correspondents for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  We perform all the due diligence for loans on apartment complexes, then securitize them into  urlLink commercial mortgage backed securities  (bonds).  The re-payment of principal and interest of which is 'guaranteed' by Fannie or Freddie - meaning, yields on loans are driven down b/c Fannie/Freddie have the implicit guaranty of the government (AAA rated, lower borrowing costs).  Net effect being Joe Schmoe might have an ass credit rating, but he can get a great interest rate if he has a good property in decent shape in a good market etc etc.  All in all, a great deal for the borrower.  A lot has been going on the last few years w/r/t this 'implicit guaranty' by the Federal Government.  Technically, Fannie and Freddie are public companies (traded over the exchanges) so they aren't really governmental organizations.  The argument against them goes, they have an 'unfair advantage' b/c they can lend at lower interest rates forcing competition (GMAC etc) out of the market.  These guys (GMAC et al) have been dogging Federal regulators to disassociate themselves with Fannie/Freddie to make the competitive landscape more even.  The problem is, politically and economically, Fannie and Freddie are the TWO 800-lb gorillas.  In order for ANYTHING to happen to their GSE (Government Sponsored Entity) status, Alan Greenspan would have to say something, as no elected official (even the President) would be willing to put the kaibosh on a MULTI-TRILLION dollar industry.

2844168,female,Marketing,"                 Today was one of those lazy, boring Saturdays. We slept in a little late, then did a little cleaning. Ked then watched a few rounds of PBS - This Old House, New Yankee Woodshop, and we watched this cheesy 80's movie 'My Science Project.' Strange.  Anyway, I then decided to be un-boring and pulled out my sewing machine to see what I could do. Six hours later, I have created a little sachet from the extra length I cut off from the dress for Shelley's wedding and nice tan purse for myself from some leftover material from cargo pants I made a couple months ago. I must say they both turned out quite nice! On the little sachet to go with the formal I found a strand of faux pearls to use for the handle and a nice clear button for a clasp. On the tan purse I thought I'd put a hemp trim lined with shells that I saw at JoAnn's a week ago. Ked ran out and got the trim (and some popcorn and whoppers) since he was bored. I'm quite pleased with how they both turned out!  It was blazing hot out then this afternoon we got another nice thunderstorm. I've never seen as much lighting as we have down here. After the storm it really cooled off and we went outside to look at the sky. In one direction it was green, in another direction the clouds looked twisty and close to the ground. It was kind of spooky and we ran back inside to turn on the tv and look for tornado warnings. Haven't heard any yet!               "

I just wasn't thinking straight because it was my last day in a place I've been living in for the past 2 years. Anyway, for those who wants my take on my day yesterday, here it is...  Well my last day at school helped me discover a very Under the Radar player in class, Benjamin Siow. I honestly did not have him on my list of targets, and he just got 1+ marks less than me in average. Well what I can tell you is that he won't be able to go UTR anymore, of he's gonna get ready to get voted off. Essentially, I won't be the one getting him exposed, I'll let the Fairplays do the job; my dearest slaves Anjan and Jason will be all over this guy once they find him out!   I was also doing some bonding with the Fairplays, through a lame coin game. But it was really nice seeing another side of them, not having to be playing the game. I was in a really good mood until a 'Jenna Awardee' came into the game. Well, his name is Samuel, and his mouth shoots off like a donkey's ass once something remotely funny comes into conversation. Not to mention his mouth smells like a donkey's ass. Some very scientifically inclined people may like to compare his words to the speed of light, and his brain to the speed of sound.           "

2821801,female,indUnk,"           Yes,  urlLink this  would rank high on the 'suck-age' scale.  Of course China is the main threat - just funny it's coming in the form of economic pressure (look at our trade gaps, and there's talk of them denominating international trades in terms of the euro, which would SEVERELY hurt the strength of the dollar.  Put it this way, what if all of a sudden you had this commodity that only you made, then, over night, 1/2 your demand just went *poof*.  International companies/countries DEMAND US$ to conduct business - it's stable, it's not going to devalue overnight (like in 1998 with the Russian debt crisis).  Blah.    In addition to the economic pressures, we're also seeing Generals (so consider the source) in the last couple years, publicly state China as the next foreign aggressor, and that they are worried about the future implications of all this shit.    In conclusion, the one thing I have to give Clinton credit for was helping China into the WTO - that is the one way we can subtlely coerce them towards capitalism, and AWAY from M.A.D. (mutually assured destruction).           "

If he doesn't email me by the time he gets off, I'm going to  kick his ass . Hahaha.  Yesterday, walking along at the fair, Ashley asked me if I was going to go to Winter Formal and Prom next year. Uh, no, I told her. She asked me, 'But what if Zach asks you?' I told her that was ridiculous and why would he ask me? 'Because you guys are friends.' Yea, but we are both friends with  other people  too, my world does not just consist of him. Yea, we do a ton of things together (during the school year) like movies, dinner, concerts, but that's different. We're not dating or in love with each other. We love each other, but as friends, of course. I'm just afraid my friends have gotten the wrong impression. Half of them have told me that me and him should get together, but it's just a friendship.

I was honest as i always was with him. i told him i was mad.i am. i am hurting. too much pain has endured because he never told me answers to my simple questions. i dont know why he did that. why he just ran away. he always does. he ran away from his family before... he ran away from school.. he ran away from me..and ran back to australia.  talk is cheap..you said that you will never go back there. you would stand on your own.. yuo love me..you want to get a good family.a good life...prove something.. but why do you always ran away?  it hurts me that you are like that. that you never keep your words...not to them..not even to me.  what is pride? regaining pride back is the only reason he gave me. but is what you did the solution to get the pride back? you just proved yourself that you cant stand on your decision before.  i dont know the answers really.. everybody who loved you..every body who beleived and supported you... you just turned them down. without saying a word. without being a man. its not about money. its not how good your job is.. its about your word. what you said before..about showing and proving your family that you can make it on your own is gone.   only you know the answer. so if pride is what ur trying to gain back.. you were 1 step close on getting it and proving it by standing on your word and fighting for the person or your future 'family', but all yuodid is throw it all away and lose all the people who gave you support and loved you like a family. mga lola, mga tita, kaibigan, lahat lahat na naniwala sayo, binigo mo lahat para lng sa sarili mo.   parang sinabi mop na rin na ' hindi ko pala kaya... sige, kayo na bahala...'  hindi habang panahon...tatakasn natin mga responsibilities natin... mga decisions...  masakit magmahal ng taong hindi mo alam kung totoo. kung andun lng sya dahil wala sya kasama. mahal pa rin kita. yoko ng ganto. ayoko ng mahal pa rin kita kahit sobrang sakit. kahit hindi ko alm kung totoo lahat. dahil hindi mo masabi..hindi mo masagot mga tanong ko ngayon...kung kailan ako ang humihingi ng konting panahon mo para sumagot.Maliit na bagay lng ang hinihingi ko.... yun lng.malaman ko lng.

My team raised over $1000 for Care Resource and the event, on last tally, had raised over 75K in all, and still growing.   urlLink AIDS WALK Miami 2003   After that little 3 mile stroll I stopped at the Farmer's Market on Lincoln Road.  If you ever find yourself on Miami Beach on a Sunday, you really should check it out.  Fresh fruits and flowers, the best baked bread I've ever tasted, and lots and lots of art and antiques.  And with a Starbucks Coffee on practically every block, you'll have no shortage of caffeine to fuel your day.  Then, once I was home I decided to take another short walk - yes walk - over to the Museum and Library downtown.  I live about 3 blocks away, and as I said before, the weather was just perfect for walking.  Saw a very thought-provoking exhibit by Shirin Neshat on the roles of men and women in Islamic Iran.  Also picked up 2 new books to read:  Dickens and Shakespeare.  Finished off the day with a lovely nap on the sofa.    Just love those Sunday afternoon naps!  I couldn't live without them.

I've got nothing to rant, nor rave about this weekend, so I guess I'll just describe to you what I did. That works.  Friday - Had early dismissal. Blah. Came home, ate, went online, and sat around until about 2:45. Then I went back to school so I could go to track practice. Yeah, I was there until about 4:30. Though, all we did was streches, blocks and 3/100's. Easy practice for Saturday. After when I came home, I did nothing, but sit around. Boring. Saturday - Got up at 7, because of my loud and ingnorant father who decided to be loud when he was getting ready for class woke me up. Left at 8:30, and stopped at the gerocry store so I could get some powerade ^_^'  continued up to the school where the bus left at 9:00, got to Austintown/Fitch at 9:30, ran the 100 in 19.5 seconds, and ran the 200 in 41.3 seconds (I could of been faster in both, damn blocks!!) I didn't get home from that until 4:30. So when I came home, I was in a really good mood, and I played a little volleyball, and sat around, until randomly Harry showed up in my house, soon followed by Dan and Ryan. Then, they ubducted me, and we went down to the school, so I could film Dan trying to do a ollie over a skateboard, on a skateboard in 13 takes >  While I was down there, I called back to my house to let my mom know where I was, and I asked her if I could spend the night. So I did, and we ended up sitting around playing the 007 game, which was being gay as hell, and Harry kept using my shoulder as a pillow, so we all ended up going to bed at like 2:30.  Sunday - Woke up at 9:30, and sat in the living room because no one else was up yet. When  everyone finally got up we all watched Weird Science (except Dan, because he was still sleeping, until he left at like 10:45) and then Dazed and Confused, I left around 1:30. Came home, ate something and did some shiz on the computer.  The guys showed up at my house at like 2:00 - ish, and then we walked to downtown Sharon, where we sat around for a few hours. Walked back to my house at 5 - ish, layed around for a hour or so, and attempted to play twister until my mom came home ><. Then, they left at 6:30 - ish. Since then I have been doing a combination of computer/cleaning/dinner/bath/alias. Yeah. Well Ima go. Alias comes on in 2 mins! Woo.    "

766556,female,indUnk,"        Blah Tuesday  Finished reading Madame Bovary last night.  I think it must have been designed to warn young girls of living a frivolous life.  Young woman falls in love, marries.  Then realizes she's not really in love.  Miserable existence, falls in love with another young man.  Resists temptation, continues miserable existence.  Another man meets her, decides he will have her.  And he does.  They have an elicit affair, and she is blissfull for 2 years.  He leaves her, and she almost dies of grief.  Runs into the first young man, falls into an affair with him.  Husband knows nothing about it.   And all the while, she gets herself & husband so far in debt that the officials come to sell her stuff.   In her final moment of desperation, she asks her current lover for help in getting money, he can't.  She goes to her first lover for help, he won't.  Instead of repenting, telling her husband the truth and seeing the error of her ways, she decides to eat arsenic and kill herself.  Husband dies of grief at losing her, their little daughter is left penniless and orphaned.    Nice bedtime story, huh?  No wonder I'm feeling low today.    Diva out.          "

883178,male,Fashion,"            Why I hate hotel gyms.   I kind of have a little ritual when I'm in NY, particularly when I have no plans in the evening.  I usually try to walk back to my hotel (about a 40-block hike), go to a deli for sushi or the salad bar, order a cheesy romantic comedy on my TV that I'd never pay for with my own money, watch it, and then at about 9pm I'll go to the hotel gym.  I go late because I hate working out when the gym is crowded.    So I was all alone two nights ago, until this short, stocky guy came in to ruin my workout time.  I was on the treadmill, minding my own business and listening to Coldplay (of course), and this guy starts up the treadmill right next to mine.  He had it going the fastest speed possible, and kind of gave me a look like 'check  this  out.'  I was not impressed.  He was running his little heart out, with me continuing my walk at a normal brisk pace.  I guess I didn't give him enough positive feedback, because he then proceeded to raise the incline.  I swear, I think his treadmill was almost at 90 degrees at one point.  By this time he was completely staring me down, wondering why I wasn't giving him a round of applause.  This totally wigged me out, so I just left.  Then last night, I went down at the same time, started my workout, and who showed up  again ...weirdo runner guy.  He gave me the stare down again, this time with a sly smile and wink that said 'I'm blatantly hitting on you'...so then I blatantly went back to my room.  Telling a guy like this off is usually no use.  But if I see him again next week, I'm going to punch him in the neck, or at least give him a piece of my mind.  And since I have longer strides than him, I'll run him into the ground for sure.          "
589736,male,Technology,"           From Ebert....  'Films like 'The Chronicles of Riddick' gather about them cadres of fans who obsess about every smallest detail, but somehow I don't think 'Riddick' will make as many converts as 'The Matrix.' In fact, I owe an apology to fans of the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy.    When Richard Roeper reviewed the current two-disc DVD of 'Lord of the Rings: Return of the King' on TV, I noted that a four-disc set of the movie was coming out later this year. He observed that the complete trilogy will come out on 'an accordion size set that will take up the next six years of your life.' I observed that 'LOTR' fans should 'get a life.' I meant this as an affectionate ironic throwaway, but have received dozens of wounded e-mails from Ring devotees who believe 'LOTR' has, indeed, given them a life, and after seeing 'The Chronicles of Riddick,' I agree. They have a life. The prospect of become an expert on 'Riddick,' in contrast, is too depressing to contemplate.'         "
