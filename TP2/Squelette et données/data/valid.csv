2844168,female,Marketing,"                 Today was a fun and relaxing day. Mom, Karon, and I headed over to Hastings and had lunch at a great local Mexican restaurant before Karon had to go to work. The food was awesome and so much better than Taco Smell! After that Mom and I headed back home and did a little scrapbooking. I finished up a nice layout of some beach pictures from when Karon visited us in March. After that Mom and I headed over to Charlotte to check out a neat little scrapbooking store. They didn't have the flamingo diecut I was looking for, but they had several other things that I didn't realize I needed until I saw them! Then we headed to the dollar store and they actually had a little section of scrapbooking supplies and I picked up a couple packs of paper. From there we headed to Wal-Mart and then we realized we were hungry and it was supper time!! After supper, Mom and I watched a couple of the Season 1 episodes from Karon's new A-Team dvd set. What a great show and so over the top! Classic t.v. for sure!!  Now I am exhausted and am sure I will sleep quite well tonight!               "

766556,female,indUnk,"        One Last Post for the day...   Finally getting the chance to go out with a co-worker/friend/fellow goddess tonight.  And what could be more appropriate for us than to go to a dinner and cabaret show - drag queen style.  This should be a blast - I need a good laugh.  You know, the kind of laugh that shakes your whole body; the kind where the next day your stomach reprimands you for doing all those damned sit-ups but you were only laughing.  Laughing till your face hurts.  Then there's the meal that comes with the dinner, the great conversation and company of Gloria and the piece de resistance  *typed with a french accent*  -- this is a free meal.  There's no better dinner than a free dinner.  I'll have to put it all in my blog tomorrow.  BTW, if Andre Gide were around today, do you think he would he have written his 'Journal' via blog?

3667495,male,Science,"                 Danielle wanted me 2 make up a story so here it is...       Once upon a time there was a place without guns...Now this place still wasn't all that peaceful, for the replacement of guns they used sticks instead. Anyways there was very few critters in this mysterious land without guns. This story takes place with a couple crittters named Master Seaworld and Myran. Both were not very bright..but together they equal one brain.  Walking miles though out the dessert Master Seaworld finally reached his destination of his life time... the golden Porta Pot... it was times like these Master Seaworld Charased these moments... So when he got there he took a dump and then left with satisfaction.     When he got back tired and ready for sleepies when he entered his room he found his buddy Myran... ready for action. Master Seaworld being a reasonable man... said 'not today Myran, I'm excectionally tired and want rest'. So Myran got mad and ran away... but came back an hour or two later. MAster Seaworld was still exsosted from his trip... but that didn't stop Myran... he ran up and jumped on his bed screaming 'I want Pan Cakes' Finally master S got up and made pan cakes and slept on the couch while watching he favoritist show ever! Franklin the Turtle on Nick Jr. All of sudden outtda now where Myran ran up with a stick in his sweaty palm and started beating Master S 2 death! So Master S finally died. Everybody was very sad...                THE END Stay tuned for the Series Coming Soon ;) I love D.J :)        "

4192173,male,Technology,"             Post blackout, Danny Boy, S.O. and I braved the hipster nightmare that is Piano’s to check out the glam man known as Saphin. First a little back story: A few years ago, while killing time at Luna Lounge, Danny Boy, Tom (excuse me, THOMAS), and I stumbled across a band playing what sounded like the soundtrack to VELVET GOLDMINE (The best soundtrack for the worst movie). Intrigued, we watched their entire set. The singer, who is Saphin (nee Jeff Saphin or JEFF) had the best elements of Ziggy-Era Bowie (including costume changes and a dressing room “tent”) and the band itself was INCREDIBLE. They had a guitar player who out-Bauhuas-ed Daniel Ash, a drummer who looked like he belonged in 25 Ta Life and a bassist who could best be described as an Israeli New Romantic. And this worked!!! And of course, they looked fantastic, so totally different, yet it all fit. This was one of those special bands in which you knew that if one element was different, it would flat-out suck. Together, these guys rivaled any major label band out there. Glam is a delicate beast to do properly and these guys tamed it and in my humble opinion, modernized it. Danny Boy was even E-mailing Saphin to make sure they would play their now classic I’M NOT GAY. Let me tell you, you have to be an amazing band to get someone like Ash to listen to songs like SEX IN THE NAME OF GOD and DAYGLO HALO. Nuff Said. They, like Saintface, became the band to see, and we were all huge fans.   And then, at one gig, JEFF announced “he” was going away to record an album and would be taking some time off. We were sad, but we couldn’t fault him (hopefully them) for wanting to make a record, at least now we could have the songs on CD! Plus, you could always surf their site, where you can learn all about JEFF, but really none of the other guys, which was annoying. Brandt ran into the guitarist, Evan Evangilista, one day in a train station and he ran away when approached. Then Evan started showing up in a band called Essex. Not a good sign…  Well, who knows what happened in between, because they did the record, and it was mediocre (and a total rip off, ask Matt Gentile, who, like me paid something like 30 bucks for a cd-r of this album). I don’t know if JEFF fired the rhythm section of they walked or what have you, its not my place to speculate as I don’t know the circumstances, but the record reflected none of that wonderful band we followed around for a year or so. Like Saintface, the frontman is the main driving force, but unlike Saintface, the band was made the frontman a star. No offense to my friends in Saintface, but the Saphin band had a unique chemistry straight off the bat that was tight and fierce. The songs were GOOD, but GREAT when that band played them. Saintface luckily has great songs (and not enough on CD, PETER!).  Then JEFF started playing again, but acoustically, which I didn’t go see as I am loyal to that band, then new band members started appearing on the website, and I wrote them off immediately. Then the decision was made to check out the all-new live band JEFF had assembled on Saturday night…It started off promisingly enough, as Saphin, in orange jumpsuit, went into the crowd offering people chips. And then the band played…  Well, S.O. didn’t make it through the first few songs, and quite Frankly, I couldn’t blame her. JEFF has a really good keyboard player (who actually adds to the material), a really decent guitarist, and a solid drummer, but that’s the problem. They’re all individually solid, but they are NOT Saphin. And to add insult to injury, Evan Evangelista was playing BASS. What the hell is that? It’s like Mick Ronson playing bass for Bowie. You don’t want the great guitar player who defined these songs playing BASS!!! UGH. The new guitar player lacks the style and substance of Evan. He is a power chord guy, and he can rock out, but the point is, Saphin is not power chord rock. I want Evan, not some guy who looks like Matthew Lillard. The problem is, these guys are good, REALLY good, but they have to compare to the previous incarnation, which was magic. Maybe they will develop in time…though probably into something different, and not something I would find interesting.  And what can I say about JEFF. He was once a glammed up androgynous alien half-breed that exuded irony like none other. Now he just seems pissed and looks like he wants to be in Interpol. The sexy innuendo is replaced by angst and it doesn’t suit those songs at all. He did show some signs of life during I'M NOT GAY, but it was too brief. Honestly, he appears to be an egomaniac, and I hope he didn’t piss off the other band members or did something stupid like fire them cause then I would be REALLY pissed at JEFF.   The costume changes are there but the fun is gone. Are Essex any good?  F          "
1932521,female,indUnk,"           ok so this one is going to be dedicated to lying becuase i think that its a problem that has infested ppl lately and it is just not cool. im not saying that everyone lies xcept for me b/c i do it too. but i just want to say that a lot of the lying that is going on right now is really hurting ppl, for example a witnessed a lie that took place about 20 minutes ago and if it were me on the other end i probably would have cried. like ditching ppl isnt cool. ill just leave it at that. and i just want to give a should out to the ppl who build on other lies : someone is ALWAYS going to find out no matter what. anf it is only going to get worse. there is no way to live a lie for your ENTIRE life, b/c eventually its going to come up again and its only going to be 10x worse then. so just stop being stupid and just admit what u need to say, or be mature and talk about it. b/c if ur lying ur obviously trying to cover something up, which really should be talked about. were all mature ppl here so, like if were me, i would have so much more respect for you if u actually laid it all out for me, and i would realize that u are being the bigger person and in the end i would later thank you for that. so thats a HINT for all those ppl out there u are NOT TALKING TO BE BECAUSE ITS REALLY BOTHERING ME BECAUSE NOT TALKING TO SOMEONE ABOUT IT IS AS BAD AS LYING ABOUT IT. its not any different.   im sorry im just in a bad mood right now b/c so many ppl lied to me tonight, are lying to mo over a spread out amount of time, or are lying to eachtoher. aye aye aye  im not sure if u would understand, but go to jason mraz's website and it explains it very well, but seriously guys, THE BOYS GONE HOME  oh and we died claires hair today, its like a light strawberry blonde, it looks good. hit me up if u want ur hair died.   sorry guys al         "

1103575,female,indUnk,"       I'm having one  of those nights. God is talking to me. I was driving to the grocery store, and I was playing some music, and was concentrating really hard on driving because it was raining pretty hard, and then I remembered our theme at school this year... 'Presence'  and in talking about this theme, we've come up with different ways to apply this... Stopping and listening to others, or being present to them; presence of mind in class; or the Presence of God.  and we keep coming back to the idea of silence as well.  Like taking the time to turn off the music and listen to what God is saying to you.  So while I was driving, I turned off the radio, and cleared my mind... well, other than focusing on the road anyway...  and was thinking about how our church has just hired a new youth minister, which I'm very excited about, and praying that this is what is best for our church, and then I started thinking about how much my church activities mean to me.  There are two things in life that I'm passionate about.  Photography, and God.  {that sounds funny, doesn't it?}  and then I started thinking about what I want to do with my life.  I want so badly to be a photojournalist at National Geographic, and travel around the world, and see everything there is to see.  and in the past, I have applied this to my faith in the idea that I would be opening up the wonders of God's world to everyone. and that I would be able to help people less fortunate etc. etc.  but I also think I might have a vocation to the Church.  Probably not like religious life or anything {though I haven't ruled it out.. but I like kids too much I think}  but I think I would be a really good youth minister, and I have the talents for it, and I love every minute of what I'm doing now.  Just like I love every minute I spend behind a camera.  So something has come to distract me from my life's focus.  And God put it there.  So now what do I do?    "
883178,male,Fashion,"           Shit.  Not sure why that is.  Everything seems to be working okay.  Dammit.  Maybe it'll come back up tomorrow.  Otherwise, I can e-mail it to Panda and see if she's got better luck.  For some reasons, the pictures stay up better when she does it, playa.         "
1550279,male,Student,"             So, I get out of summer school today to go eat lunch. Wendy's, long line; Whataburger, long line; Chick-Fil-A,  extremely  long line; McDonald's, 4 cars? Maybe they're having problems due to the massive power outages we've been having, but I went over there since I figured I could get my food faster.   Yeah, it went faster, but I was very impressed by the system they have set up. Instead of using the normal speaker, there were 2 women standing outside with PDAs in their hands. 2 cars at a time would give their order, and it would be transmitted wirelessly into the kitchen. Then, they had a manager with a money belt standing near the first window so that both cars could pay at the same time. Then, each of the cars head to the second window to get their food right as the next set of cars is coming around. No wonder there's no line, even Chick-Fil-A's dual lane system doesn't work as well (or else they're about 100x as popular).  Still, the point remains that I think this is an awesome use of technology and that more restaurants should make use of features like this. Not just fast food, but also places like Chili's and other sit-down restaurants. Waiter is ready to take your order? He sends it back to the kitchen to speed up the process. Need a refill on that drink? Give something to the customers so that they can signal when they need one. If restaurants started to embrace technology with ideas like this, I'd gladly pay a few extra dollars each time I went there to help support the costs. 10 years from now, no telling how we'll be getting our food, but I can assure you that it will rely on technology much more than it does now.

883178,male,Fashion,"            I think only Duf wants my reaction   I have a feeling most readers don't care what I think about the Cubs (DJS may fit into this category).  But if you  need  to know, initially I wanted to rip that clown's head off.  I'm sure if I would have been at the game, I would have thrown my beer at him like everyone else.  But then I thought about it.  What's a baseball fan's first reaction when a ball is coming towards him/her?  To reach out for it and try to grab it (or at least protect yourself from it).  Sure, 'that fan' could have taken the high road and stepped back from it, all while trying to get everyone else to back up too, but most likely there would have been some other idiot trying to jump over these people to get his hands on a championship ball.  I think it was instinct, and he went for it, especially because the ball looked like it was out of play.  It's unfortunate, but you can't tell me the same thing couldn't happen again.  And that one instance did  not  cost the Cubs the game.  This was not the only chance the Cubs had to recover.  How about the bobbled possible double play?  No one is threatening to kill Alex Gonzalez (the dumb fool).  It was a terrible, unbelievable upset.  (Not that I  care , or anything...)  So how 'bout those Red Sox?  Will the curse be lifted?         "
589736,male,Technology,"           An excerpt from Ebert's review of the revival of 'Eyes Without a Face'...  *****  '....One of the tasks faced by serious filmgoers is to distinguish good films in disreputable genres. It is insufferable to claim you 'never' see horror movies (or Westerns, musicals, war movies, teenage romances or slasher pictures). You're presenting ignorance as taste.  The trick is to find the good ones. The French auteur critics did a lot of helpful spadework, resurrecting genres and rehabilitating reputations, but they were not always right -- and besides, you have to feel it for yourself. If a film holds my attention, it is in one way or another a good one. If it moves or delights me, it may be great. If I am distracted by its conventions, obligatory scenes and carelessness or lack of ambition, it deserves to be tossed back into the genre.'          "

1415200,female,Student,"       How can spending so much time with one person, make them mean so much to you, even though, you know, they don't think of you as anything?..I don't know what to think anymore. Things like this make me so aggravated. You have no clue.     "
4313749,female,indUnk,"            Mornin, y'all.      Interesting bits in the news this morning. First off, over 750 fell sick while visiting South Bass Island in Lake Erie this summer. They're not sure what to blame it on... hm... could it be partly because the Great Lakes are some of the most polluted waters in the nation? You stick your hand in the cesspool, you ain't getting it back. It's almost as bad just to breathe in the sea spray. Or- it could be a dirty restaurant worker who failed to wash their hands after a potty break... You see why I don't like to eat at restaurants so much anymore? A pube in the food is enough to turn any stomach.      In other news, the porn industry may require their participants to wear protection. And it only took how many outbreaks of the clap and AIDs to spark this course of action?       Well, another interesting night in the Olympic arena. A white man can  run , and fast. Hats off to Jeremy Wariner for disproving all sports analysts and 99% of spectators who thought a white athlete would never beat a sprinter of any other color.       And- would you believe it- a  raucous  night in gymnastics?       It seems that the crowds have gotten tired of the scores that the judges are giving. After a practically perfect vault from Romania's Marian Dragulescu, the judges almost  begrudgingly  gave him a 9.9- I can't remember the last time I've seen a 10 in this sport.   No one in the world can vault like Dragulescu. No one can stick a landing after a front triple like Dragulescu. A 10 wasn't in the cards, but he's supposed to be happy with a 9.9?    At that point, he was sitting pretty ranked #1. After his score flashed, he hid the disappointment, but fell on his landing on a vault that should have been a walk in the park. You tell me that he wasn't affected by his score.    Move to the parallel bars- same story. A flawless performance by Hiroyuki Tomita was surpassed by a gymnast who was far less powerful and daring. On high bar, Alexei Nemov completed an unheard of six- count 'em, folks,  six-  release moves and stuck his landing. What was his score? 9.7 . It was enough to rile up the crowd and boo the judges. It lasted for ten minutes, postponing Paul Hamm's routine, until Nemov stood up and urged the crowd to stop. Hamm's performance was nearly void of any discrepancy, but in my opinion, not good enough to surpass Nemov, which he did. Unsurprisingly. Hamm won the silver, Nemov's score was enough to send him home in 5th place.    It was a Malaysian judge who didn't think Nemov was good enough for a medal. Didn't you all know? Malaysia is the world's leading producer of first-rate gymansts! Sure are- they keep 'em all in a box underground and they're planning a release in time for the 2012 games.     In other news... I haven't suffered a wedgie yet today.    Peace.                                     "

This would be typical of a Thursday, but, its Wednesday...Today, while watching 'Pirates of the Caribbean' in French class, I decided I should pursue a career in such a field. Thievery,murder and such...I may also be suited to taking up a job as a con artist...Either occupation would be mentally stimulating.

But, it continually comes back to how she handles conflict. She will be upset for some particular reason; Instead of informing you of what you did, or how to mend it, she isolates herself and pouts for days upon days, being snide, until she gets over it. Acts as if nothing has happened.  Philosophical question of the day: Is it possible to live a fatalistic life?         "

766556,female,indUnk,"        Valentines Day  Bah - humbug!  Took my girls to an amazing belly dancing performance last night.  It was great, open theater on Lincoln Road - a 'pedestrian mall' with shops and sidewalk cafes.  The speakers were 10 feet high, blasting out Middle Eastern music.  The dancers came out by ones and twos, all glittery with their sequins and body glitter.    It really was so entrancing.  We sat there with about 300 other spectators, clapping and making the required 'la-la-la-la-la-la!' sound, equivalent to the American 'Woooooooooooooo!' or Latin 'Epaaaa!'.  We had such a great time.  And, it was such a joyful night.  Really.  Watching the beauty of the dance filled me with pure energy and joy - it's not really something I can explain or relay to anyone.  Especially through written word.  All I can say it that I'm going to have to get some belly dancing music this weekend, and there will be two little belly dancers writhing and twirling through my living room all next week.  Kala has already selected a few scarves from her dresser for the performance.  And don't be surprised when I tell you all about my first belly dancing class.    Diva out.         "

3176655,male,Engineering,"                 So I think I'm getting stupid...  and it sucks.    Some time last week I was on the phone in the back yard smoking, when I finished my cigarette I proceeded to come inside.  The sliding door was open so I just walked in...walked in is right...right into the screen door.  My brother-in-law still busts on me for that.    A few days later I take another way home right, to avoid traffic.  So I'm driving down the street (in the opposite direction from what I usually do) and I notice that there are a lot of cars parked.  So I pick a spot between two unfamiliar cars thinking maybe someone's having a party.  Parallel park effortlessly, it was great.  Then I get out and approach the door, finally it dawns on me.  'Where's the huge mound and trees?'  I was about a block short of my house, so I stood there for a few minutes trying to decide weather to move the car or just walk, finally I decide to move it.  So I walk up to the door, put the key in, and guess what... it doesn't turn.  I got all embarrassed and pissed, then I realized that I just didn't put it in far enough, so I went inside defeated.    On a completely different topic I was watching Trading Spaces with my sister this weekend and Vern was painting a room red, the walls and the ceiling, and my sister and I got to talking:    Traci: Vern likes Red. Me: Vern really likes Red. Traci: Red is Vern's favorite color. Me: Vern loves Red. Traci: Vern really loves Red. Me: Vern's gonna marry Red.    I really think some good points were brought up in that conversation so I thought I'd share.               "

2844168,female,Marketing,"                 Chillin in the Sun (can you chill in the sun?? Hmmm...)  Our weekend shaped up rather nicely. Ked spent Saturday working on his portfolio and resume and some OPMG projects. He and his skills are absolutely amazing. I was reviewing his new and improved PDF portfolio tonight and man!! I married an amazingly talented man. Speaking of portfolio and resume stuff, please pray for us over the next few weeks. Ked is getting ready to send a blitz of resumes out, and sent one tonight that would be a sweet opportunity. We would covet your prayers - that God would lead Ked exactly where He wants him and open doors of opportunity that no man can shut.  So while Ked was working on that Saturday, I spent the day scrapbooking!! I am the scrapbooking queen!! I get such an emotional lift from completing pages and finishing scrapbooks. I'm well on my way to wrapping up 2003. I have the goal of getting completely caught up this year. (I think it's every scrapbooker's never ending goal.) The way I've been booking it lately I just might make it.  Sunday was an absolutely gorgeous day and we try to make it a po!nt to get out and enjoy our Sunday afternoons. After church we came home and lounged by the pool for a couple hours. Ked (who has a perma-tan but always complains about how pale he is) got a nice jumpstart on his tan. In fact, today he is slightly pink!! After veggin by the pool we decided to go for a rollerblade. After my last incident, I made sure to wear thicker socks this time. We determined that we are going to need new rollerblades soon. Our current ones are six years old and have seen a lot of use. Mine were squeaking and groaning and making all kinds of noise. Actually, I was groaning and making noise too! Ked's just coasting along, but his extra pounds make it a lot of work for me to keep up with him!   We finished out our Sunday by having a cookout at Dave and April's place. They are in our Life Group, and we had a blast visiting with them. Dave grilled some delicious cajun grouper! They live on a lake and are serious wakeboarders. They took us for a spin on their boat and gave us the jungle tour of the lake. We're planning on trying to wakeboard sometime soon with them! That should be interesting. I've never been waterskiing or boarding before!!  Today was my whirlwind cleaning day and I got quite a bit accomplished. This week is going to be extra special. Our Michigan friends Dennis and Hilary are in Orlando with their little guy Grant for a couple weeks. Ked took Thursday and Friday off work and we're planning on hanging out with them at Disney (for our 3rd time this year - thank you Uncle Dan!) on Thursday and then chillin the rest of the weekend with them. They left Grand Rapids 6 months before we did and we've dearly missed doing life with them.   Ta-ta for now!               "

3389671,male,indUnk,"       As you may have noticed by the fact that it is plainly stated above, I am in a bad mood. I couldn't sleep at all last night and when I did drift off for a short period of time I had a strange dream about  Optimus Prime and I hiding in a room on a space station that looked surprisingly like the pharmacy at the hospital I work in. It seemed that most of the Autobots were being mind controlled and they were looking for us. Optimus wasn't in high spirits and neither was I.   So, I'm tired and cranky and I have a sore throat and so when I got to work I decided to do what any sane person would do at work and try to plan my class schedual for next semester. This turned out to be the wrong thing to do on an already bad day. Budget cuts at school have now hit home for me. There is a greatly decreased number of Tuesday/Thursday classes and some of my favorite teachers arn't teaching the classes I need to take, which is okay because the classes arn't at time I can take them anyways.   Why is it patriotic to blindly support every war Bush takes us into but it's okay to let education funding slide. Wanna talk about patriotism, how about putting some stock in this countries future and educating people for a change. Our big bad weapons wont mean shit when others develop energy shields and were left behind because were a nation of dumbasses that don't care about funding education.   I was going to talk about a bunch of other stuff but I just got blindsided by my bad day. I need to talk to a counselor about what classes I can take for my major now that I can't take the math class I need or the programming class I need.          "

649790,female,indUnk,"               Big Event    E-Gene had his knee operation today, to fix his torn ligament (soccer soccer soccer...the bane of all knees...)  Went with him in the morning, and checked into St Vincent's Private. Not bad - the room is pretty retro - the wallpaper, floor, TV etc. He has his own room and bathroom, so it's cool. The meals are pretty good - I know 'coz i ate his! (MMMM....yummy satay beef skewers on jasmine rice with peanut sauce, caesar salad, bread roll with butter, fruit salad, fizzy lemonade and clear consomme.) He wasn't allowed to eat anything coz of the anesthesia. He could have had something to eat in the morning, but coz we thought the Op was at 11 or 12, the time he checked in, so he didn't have anything to eat. In the end the Op was actually scheduled for 4pm.  Anyways, in the afternoon I left for the Apple store, came back but missed 'seeing him off' to the operating theatre. It was about 5pm, so I hung out at a cafe for the next couple hours, then went to wait in his room and watched TV there. He came back about 8.15-8.20 pm.   He came back looking woozy and tired - he was under General Anesthesia after all. He's now on a morphine drip 'coz he's allergic to other painkillers - and it's self-administered. Hmm...wonder if anyone ends up euthanising themselves by accident...  Anyways, thank God the operation went well. He seems fine, and will probably be out on Friday or Saturday. Check back for more details on this page!     Just a quick update on my iBook situation.    Yesterday I ran a check using Disk Doctor. It was pretty cool 'coz i used it via Wally's Disk Doctor, installed on his Powerbook, through FireWire. I couldn't start up the Disk Doc using the CD so had to use my iBook as FireWire disk, and scan my HD on Wally's Powerbook.  It was so cool! We connected the FireWire cable, pressed T as my iBook started up, and voila! My iBook's contents appeared on Wally's desktop! Woohoo Macs rule!  Anyways, went to the other Apple Centre today. The IT guy there was really nice. I explained what happened, and mention the *ahem* small knock it had.  Told him my dilemma of warranty running out, as well as the countless assignments due. He said no prob, he'll register my problem, so when I go see him again (when I can in a few weeks time after essays are done), the warranty would still cover it. Excellent! So now I have time to do my assignments, and also try reinstalling Word for OS X again to see if that could fix the problem.   (Am doing work on Word for OS 9 right now btw. For non-Maccers, with the new platform, my iBook has 2 operating systems - OS X and OS 9.2. Programmes on OS 9.2 can start up in OS X via Classic mode, which is what I'm doing now with Word. Capeesh?)  The IT guy was pretty cool. He's like one of those 'dude' IT guys lah - streaked blonde hair etc. And he kept saying 'no dramas' meaning 'no problem'. So now it's Charles' (who was also there to collect his new OS X software) and my catchphrase - No Dramas! haha...  Oh yes. Got a poster as well from the place. Pretty nice. It's the iMac - but the old one lah, not the new one. Am planning to pop by other Apple stores to see if they have other posters that are just stocking up...           "

I just went to the Craig David concert and the show was good (not as good as Prince mind you but I like Craig David better, and yes I went to that one twice on the weekend.)  The show was good, he was good, the seats were excellent!!..  It was all in all a good night... There was some trash on parade though, the outfits of some of the people were shocking!! Not to mention the ages, there was heaps of young girls and older people too. He reaches all people.. which is cool...  Anyway, what I was trying to say is that I think fame is a weird concept. We waited after the concert to see Craig David come out of the backstage door and after a long wait he eventually did. It was very weird to see him in person, in full view and in a normal setting, walking around, getting into a car.   And it must be weird for him that there were hundreds of people waiting for that..,.... I don't know what I'd be like if there were fans waiting for me to come out of my house every day or to go shopping, even for groceries..   I guess we take stuff like that for granted.. I don't know how he lives but it must be well even though it would be lonely..   And all those fans, wanting to know things about you, everything, to see you and hear you.. theres a bitter irony to it all...  but i guess i'll never know because I am not waiting to be famous, i only know what its like to wait to see somebody famous..   Prince was also a strange thing to see. We could see his face better as he had big screens and it was also surreal.. The show was much more 80s and funky, and the band was great.. Also, Prince ended up being on for 2 and 1/2 hours but Craig David was only on for 1 and 15 I think.. but he has less songs.  At Prince  everyone danced ... at this one, the fans were too reserved and only a percentage of the crowd stood up..   For the Prince concert I went because my boyfriend had a ticket that a friend had bailed on but we still had a good time.. he enjoyed it so much and I liked seeing him having fun, dancing and singing. That was on last friday night, the 24th.  Then the next night the 25th I worked at it and went in after with friends. It was less packed and had less of a party vibe.. so I was definitely glad that i went the first night..   So now am relaxed but had a big day, i'll write more later when I have the time..

Tuesday, 9th September 2003  SAGITTARIUS  (Nov 23 - Dec 21)   For a long time you have been living in hope. A change is on the way. This ought to be good news but you find it slightly disturbing. Somehow, in your effort to make a waiting process bearable, you have managed to make it comfortable. Indeed, you have settled so well into your psychological seat that you no longer feel inclined to get out of it. You have not forgotten what it was you were hoping for, but you now see that, if a dream really is to become a reality, awkward adjustments must be made. Indeed they will. But you won't regret this.   Millions may not understand, but believe me; on this one he is so right its scary.

4063217,female,Law,"   My first year as an attorney has had its ups and downs.  I guess that is to be expected, but the ups are certainly more fun than the downs.  Of course, the first and most important up was the raise I received upon passing the bar exam.  The first down was being threatened with Rule 11 sanctions, but that worked itself out and was simply the result of an older attorney from a big firm trying to bluff the new kid in the small firm.      In the beginning there was very little change in what I did as a law clerk and what I do as an attorney, the main difference being that I could finally sign my own name to my work.  I still ran to my higher ups for approval before filing anything, but over the last few months, I have actually been generating business.  Now that I have my own clients and my own caseload, it's much easier to pick something up and run with it than it was when other attorneys' clients were on the line.      I've done quite a few depositions and a few hearings.  Working in the firm that I'm in, I get to do a little bit of every kind of law, plaintiff and defense work, personal injury, class actions, insurance claims and defenses, EEOC claims, Workers' Comp claims, Social Security, the occasional divorce, etc.   At least, things rarely get boring.   The down side to that is there's alot of research involved due to the fact that we work with so many different types of cases, and many many briefs to be written.    As far as my personal life goes, I've finally given in and bought a house of my own.  It's nice to know that for once in my life, I don't have to worry about how I'm going to make the payments on things.  Of course, it's all my responsibility now too.  That was a little scary at first, but I guess that's just part of being a member of the real world instead of just a student.      Between the new responsibilities at work and the new responsibilities at home, things get a little stressful sometimes.  On the up side though, we've got two new law clerks at work and I've been given full permission to make use of them.  Oh the joys of inflicting terror into the hearts of the young and gullible.  It's my turn now to have the clerks cowering before my verbal abuse and unrealistic demands.  I learned well from the associate I worked under.  Seriously, I love my law clerks and I wouldn't dream of being mean to them.  The worst thing I've ever done is refer to their office as the day care center and the office manager as their babysitter.     "
589736,male,Technology,           an incredibly important article to read  urlLink http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/27/magazine/27DETAIN.html          
3358564,female,Education,"   Grades are due on Weds. Ok, so right now I should be grading the pile of provocative research papers sitting on my right--hah! No comment!  I was getting sleepy. I'm also doing laundry.  I seem to be doing a lot of laundry the past few days.  But I suppose it is something I need to do: washing out my soul.  What is this Monday? I realize something about myself; I think I'd like a nice guy in my life.  I wanted not to think about K, so I read Edith Wharton's 'The Buccaneers' in,like, two days.  Yes, it was her last novel, incomplete, and I could sense where the other writer completed it.  In the end, the language was too late twentieth century.  Kind of like when you read the last of Shakespeare's plays, you can tell where Fletcher moves in.  But anyway Back to Wharton,  Guy Thwarte, is our hero in this novel.  He is everything Ethan Frome, and Newland Archer are not.  It seems to me at least, that Wharton finally wanted to create a male character who is able to live outside convention. Thwarte has this wonderful ability to be a nonconformist.  He's so nice, sincere, kind, respectful, romantic as hell, and he gets it.  He understands that life is more than what we have--things, things, things! He's just content to live comprehending poetry and art and Love!   Ahhh!    Maybe, I shouldn't read novels like this when I am in such a romantically disillusioned state. I must say, today, I am in love with Guy Thwarte! He was having a conversation with our heroine, Annabell (Nan)St. James, and he talks about this notion of 'beyondness.'  In the strict setting of order and tradition where they find themselves, the lovers both share an understanding of the beauty of life.  They both know that it cannot be defined with money, or influence, but rather through art, culture, & a deep passion for humanity.    Oh, maybe my heart is just hurting a little!  I don't even feel jaded because I knew how K was made.  But, I just don't understand his meanness (is that a word?). It's something so foreign.  Why be sour?   I just need to be 'got', I suppose.  I need to meet the right Guy. I'm not really lonely.  I know how that feels, and it is something I'm not ashamed of, but it would just be nice to be understood by the other gender.  One who says, 'I get you, and your nutty jumbled chaos.'   And while I'm making all these intimate disclosures, I may as well write it--I need to be Kissed.  K--didn't kiss too well!  I could really use a deep kiss by a sweet and brainy and dreamy guy who speaks my language!  And a long gaze too!  A very long gaze into my eyes--yes, indeed!  enough written, & I'm so glad nobody reads this gushing. (Nobody, right? uhm blush)  Jumbled Chaos "

It was glorious - the water was cool, but oh so refreshing, and when we came upon Crystal's favourite swimming spot, there was not a soul in sight... soooo nice, just us, the sunshine, and the water. But then, 2 minutes later a rather large group of people ambled down the path... sigh, so much for solitude - but what can you expect from such a divine swimming place? After swimming up the river aways and watching some boys jump off cliffs into the water (yikes - i just keep picturing my cousin with his lacerated spleen from landing badly off a 30 foot cliff a couple weeks ago), we swam back an prepared ourselves for some much needed sunbathing. (well that only lasted for a little while until we had to break open the food bag and munch for a while - mmmm more good food like samosas and veggies and trail mix, and crystal's homemade candied ginger, oatmeal and chocolate chip cookies!) It was a wicked way to spend the day. When we arrived home, it was time to check out some of the summer olympics - rowing and gymnastics to be specific (those gymnists can do some crazy shit i tell you).

883178,male,Fashion,"            To The Strength...To Go The Length, Thinking You Are First When You Really Are Tenth?     1) Do you have a favorite travel destination?  I like going to the ocean.  I know that's pretty general, but it's true.  I don't care if I'm in Oregon, Ca-li-for-ni-a, or even on the east coast, seeing that much water crashing into the delicious land does something for me.  But, if I were to make a full-on decision, I guess I'd say I like seeing the ocean from the Santa Monica pier.  I've been there a bunch of times and I find it pretty difficult to turn around and go back where I came from.  Yeah, I know.  I'm not very well-traveled...yet.   2) In getting to your destination, do you have a travel horror story? (flying, driving, riding bus, etc.)   I remember going to California when we were kids and believe it or not, the trip to the actual state aboard the plane went without a hitch.  It was when we landed and tried to find (in my dad's words) the 'son of a bitchin' hotel.'  I kid you negative when I say we spent a good 2.5 hours in the car, exhausted from the flight, listening to my dad go apeshit in the front seat while he told Mama Shovelpants 'he knew where he was going, goddammit.'  Other than that, I've got nothing horrible to report...at least to that destination.   3) Do you have a destination horror story? (got robbed, boring city, disgusting hotel, etc.)   I've got a few.  Philidelphia - I took a roadtrip with a previous girlfriend and we made all of our hotel arrangements over the phone.  I never understood how this was done because you never really know what kind of place you're getting yourself into.  So, we were going to Philly to see Madonna on her last tour and we booked a room in a hotel that was like 3 stars or something.  Not bad, right?  Wrong.  When we got there, the place was being totally renovated...and not for the better of the hotel.  The swimming pool (which it announced online as being open and beautiful) hadn't had any water in it since 1973.  The elevator up to the room looked like it had been shot up with bullets and beaten with a sledgehammer.  It creaked and farted as we went up to the 10th floor.  I thought, 'Well...at least our room will be okay.'  Right?  Wrong again, suckerhead.  I am not even kidding when I say it looked like there had been a homicide in our room.  There were unidentifiable stains on the carpet, a real mildewy smell to the place, ratty bedspreads, shitty artwork from a dying/starving artists sale, and a view of the 'hood.'  For a couple of very white-bread 20-somethings, this wasn't good.  The kicker was that I had driven straight through from Minnecrapolis to this shithole with about an 1.5 hours of sleep.  This was supposed to be my oasis...my pot o' gold at the end of the interstate rainbow.  'Twas not to be.  I looked the place over and was horrified at what I saw.  Old chips and shit under the bed intermingled with dust-bunnies.  Behind one of the pieces of art, I noticed some maroon-colored splatter marks.  I've read a lot of true crime books, kids...I know what that is.  Blood.  From the looks of it, someone blew their brains out all over the wall and the cleaning staff must've given it a quick wipe with a Wet-0ne.  Needless to say, we got the hell out of Dodge and found a nicer, more expensive hotel.  We even got free cookies.  The second one was when I helped my friend Jay move to Orlando, Florida.  Not only did I get a $212.00 speeding ticket in Sconie (oooh, I hate that) but once we got into Florida, we got in possibly the worst (and almost deadly) accident ever.  In the left lane, some ass-clown hit (and killed) a dog.  He slammed on his brakes and came to a complete stop.  As such, the cars behind him (us included) we screwed.  To Jay's credit, he swerved out of the left lane and saved us from a nasty rear-end collision.  The bad part is, we clipped a minivan which sent us spinning across 4 lanes of busy Florida traffic.  Let me repeat that.  We SPUN across 4 lanes of traffic.  At one point, I could see the cars coming down the freeway directly at us as we spun off and landed ass-backwards in the ditch.  Neither of us was hurt and amazingly, no one else, save the dog, was killed.  No doubt about it, it sucked.  The thing that made me most mad was that the asshole who started the 7-8 car pileup drove off before the cops came.  Some people...         "

Much of this is due to the weekend I had and several messages I received during the past two days.  I got up early and volunteered at The Botanical Garden again.  I always enjoy the time spent puttering around in the dirt, beautifying the garden and doing good for Mother Nature.  I shared my concerns about getting a team together at work for a big volunteer project on November 1st and the lack of interest and teamwork I experience in the office.  Someone reminded me that you cant make people want to help, just offer the opportunity and hope that they get involved.  Then, at church on Sunday, the message was all about partnership in service.  What service means and how it means different things to different people and why some people just dont get involved.  Someone else spoke on how to energize yourself after doing service for others.  Last night I attended an Appreciation Dinner hosted by the Dragon Boat Race Committee and I received a certificate for my efforts at the event last weekend.  I was touched by the consideration, and the food was really good.  Toward the end of the evening, the volunteer coordinator commented on how his faith had been restored after witnessing the willingness of people to get involved and help out.    He took the words right out of my mouth.  Im working on getting a team together for Hands On Miami Day and will plan an appreciation luncheon right afterwards.

But I don't.  Because not only am I a Diva, but I am also a single mom, and let's face it -- kids are expensive!  But, being that my  BIRTHDAY IS ON SATURDAY  I decided to pamper myself.  That and the fact that my hair was strangely reminiscent of cousin It.    Nothing drastic, no major chopping was done.  But, why is it that as soon as I get home I realize that I liked my hair the way it was.  I ultimately decide that I don't like what was done and that I could have done a much better job with hedge clippers and saved myself the 50 bucks I just spent.  Then, I almost always grab my scissors and destroy what I just spent 50 bucks on.  I try to resist the urge, but it is overwhelming and I almost always give in to just a few little snips here and there.  And then, finally, I come to the realization that in a few weeks it will grow back and I will be just fine.  *ugh*  BTW, did I mention that my  BIRTHDAY IS ON SATURDAY ?  Diva out.         "

4187809,female,Communications-Media,"             Ok, this whole blogging thing is an interesting oxymoron for me. I'm referring to the idea of publishing your private thoughts to be read by the general public, people i don't even know. And then this thought occurred to me... what about allowing your family to read it? I'm not sure about most people, but for me, I think I don't spend enough time with my family, in fact, i think they don't really know me very well at all.  Is it my fault for not making time for them? yes, I think so in some ways.  But the thought of my family reading my  JOURNAL ...whoa... that's scary. But it shouldn't be that way, right? I mean, my family is supposed to be the people closest to me.  I have another blogger friend, she lets her mom reads her blogs. And it's all about her relationship with her mom. Or rather, lack of it. Makes her mom pretty upset sometimes.      So should there be a self-censorship to who should be allowed to view your blog?        Do the contents of your blog change if you knew certain people read it? People whom you are afraid of being open to?      Well, right now, i'm not sure if i can be so open and honest to EVERYONE. But the strange thing is that, since I'm publishing this, I  AM  being open in some ways. I think i confuse myself sometimes.  And so I can publish my inner thoughts to the world out there, but somehow find it hard to let the closest people to me read the very same words.          "

883178,male,Fashion,"           PB,  I heard about that debacle this morning.  I was in shock.  That priest's altar-side manner could use a touch up!  Duf'         "
1708471,female,indUnk,"           First off I am going to say that The Return of the King or the 3rd Lord of the Rings, is the pimpest movie ever and even though it's 3 hours and 15 minutes long and has like 5 endings, it's still the best movie ever and ya'll should go see it. And if you hadn't noticed, I just saw that movie, and I didn't fall asleep or leave the theater once, which ya'll should know is an accomplishment for me.   Ok so throughout the movie, and well I think about this randomly a lot too, why do some words stick out in peoples heads more than others? Why are somethings funny, somethings sad, and somethings boring? Like really how do somethings attract to some people but not others? I don't really know where I'm going with with this, but it's randomly poped up in my head a lot and it's just weird how one person can see something and other can't. It's not just like that in movies or comedy, but in life and in people. How can one person see a quality that one may pocess and another not? Why do some people laugh at others jokes and others not? I don't get it, but maybe it was something I or anyone else will never know. I think it's that I just thought to much about it and ya this is where it has lead me.  And ya I'm sure most of it has to deal with your personality too, if you're a shallow person or well-rounded, if you like to have fun or sulk all the time. Who knows.  There's one thing that I must say is very weird. Usually when it's winter break I like jump for joy and am excited about it every second of the day. But this year it's different, I feel more overwhelmed then ever and almost more stress because it's like here's two weeks to take a break and have fun, but I'm not thinking about that, all I can think about is how much shit I have to get done this break and how I have like 5 essays to write, but really don't want to because Iw ant to spend 2 seconds of my life not thinking about homework or school. It's crazy but I honestly had a dream about my college writing paper and then during the movie randomly the thought of my paper came up too. I think it makes me more pissed off that we have a break, because for me it's really not a break, it's a time to catch up on everything that I've missed and start and finish things that need to be done. I also have to figure out when to get all my presents done by  and deal with hockey and soon lacrosse. Things just don't seem right anymore, they just don't flow and I don't know how to approach it anymore, I honestly don't. I know I say this all the time, but I just want to live one day without any worries or complaints or stress, just one day.  I'm tired though and I'm see this all turning into shit soon 'cause I can't think and barely remember the last word I just wrote. So ya night!   Make a true estimate of your own ability, then raise it ten percent.   Kati         "

766556,female,indUnk,"          I'm back.   I'm not dead, although chocolate is always welcomed.    Just been super busy, which of course means I've been super happy.  As mentioned, Wednesday's Wine Club event was fabulous.  Halloween trick or treating was a blast.  Went door to door in a quiet little neighborhood and the girls got lots and lots of treats.  Friday I was supposed to go to a party, but I just didn't have the strength to make the 60 mile drive.    Saturday was Hands On Miami Day; I was assigned to painting a mural in a Salvation Army homeless shelter.  I must say that I was very impressed with the comfort and cleanliness of the shelter - it was more like a nursing home, but with mothers and children.  Made me feel good just knowing that these children - very much like my own - were safe with a roof over their heads.  Just gave me the warm & fuzzies --  no smart ass comments, Joe!   Saturday night was the Bug Ball, where my Wine Club sponsored the wine for the party.  Very nice collection of socialites and party-goers together for the good of the garden.    Sunday I stayed in bed till noon - I just didn't have the energy to get up until then.  Monday was catch up time in the office, and I'm finally back on track and on-line.  So, no Joe.

Do people you interact with day to day or family members know about your journal/blog? Why or why not?  Most of the people I tell about it look at me funny or forget the address, so they never read it anyway.  My parents definitely don't know...mom would be sorely disappointed in her angelic daughter.  I would never again tell anyone I'm dating about it...how could I give y'all the dish otherwise?   3. Do you have a theme for your journal/blog?  1) Bono 24-7-365; 2) Time to get our drink on.   4. What direction would you like to have your journal/blog go in over the next year??  I definitely think we should continue to add embarrassing photos of our members...I'll be sure to bring my camera to Minneapolis in March.   5. Pimp five of your favorite journals/blogs.?

There are definite downsides to where I work: the constant travel, bitchy/demanding clients, horrible management, mediocre pay, impossibility for advancement...but I digress.  There are upsides too: I almost ALWAYS leave the office by 5 (except for the days I'm traveling 'til 9pm), I get to play whatever music I want at whatever volume (unless Robert is on a conference call; then he gets pissed), sometimes we play cards or have arguments about religion or politics for hours on end without disruption from our bosses, Thirsty Fridays, and making fun of our weird co-worker J who always screws us during happy hour by ordering about 5 Chivas on the rocks and then splitting the whole bill 4 ways.  But today is great.  Today we finally got our phone headsets in the mail.  You know, the hands-free headsets call center people usually wear.  I feel like I need to call up someone and make a huge deal, all while making very dramatic hand gestures.  I've been calling everyone I know, just to 'test it out.'  Maybe I'll call Hal next.  She loves to get calls at work.  Or my brother, who I try to make laugh just because he sits next to one of the Presidents of the bank.  Hands-free = good times.         "

3581210,male,InvestmentBanking,"             Whenever I see a pregnant Korean lady I really feel for her, because I know that within a few months she will have a 3-5 year sentence to complete and utter child-rearing duties.  As with most things Korean, mothers go all out...right from before conception to...well, it never stops.    Today I got a taste of that.  What a day!  My 3-year old (Spencer) woke me up at 9AM (which is early seeing as I still have some jetlag and was up from midnight to 3AM last night).  The younger, Winston, was already up, too.  My wife and I must have fed these kids like 5-7 times during the day, they just never stop!  Spencer and I went to his swimming class.  We get a discount on regular swimming since he's enrolled.  The gal behind the counter asked if he was swimming outside of the class as well...I really had no idea what was happening and said, 'I'm not sure.'  She said, in no uncertain terms, that it meant a lot to her whether he was or not.  I just said, ok, he is, how much?  Let's see $1.30 plus $2.60...$3.90.  You've got to be kidding?! You're bent about chun-on? (1,000 won/$1.15)?  This would not happen in Seoul.  They'd see Spencer and pay HIM to come into there!  Anyways, what I did with him in the pool was pretty much what the 'instructor' did as well...but she had 3 kids to handle.  I thought he'd be doing lengths or strokes, but I guess not yet.  After swimming I got my wife a Starbucks coffee.  She loves the stuff, and apparently can't justify to herself to buy herself one...those selfless Korean women, bless their hearts.  After I came home there was shopping to do.  I volunteered to go (kudos for me and time to think), then I suggested Spencer come too (thought he'd fall asleep in the car, especially after swimming) then thought we might as well all go (the list she gave me was going to take a couple of people to complete).  Well, the kids stayed up the whole time and I started to realize that this parenting thing is a lot harder when the kids are actually in the country with you (I'm usually in Seoul) and it's just you two (her mother and sister were out of town).  Good God, these kids didn't sleep until 11PM!  Someday they'll make great investment bankers, I mused.  To all those out there who are single parents, or even just parents, get yourself a Starbucks...you may not be able to drink it before it gets cold, but at least you have a piece of luxury in your hand for a few seconds.

883178,male,Fashion,"            I've Surpressed Political Blogs for a Long Time, but I Can't Remain Silent on This One  By Duf Fer  California.  What the hell are you doing out there?  Last November, Gray Davis is re-elected.  In January, he begins his second term.  In April (or so) multi-millionaire Congressman Darrrell Issa begins a drive to recall him.  In July, it succeeds.  In October, Davis will face a recall election.  In other words, for no malfeasance whatsoever, a sitting Governor may be ousted less than one year after he was re-elected.  The cost to California taxpayers?  $70,000,000.  Nice (if only it could happen in MN)!  Why recall Davis?  Well, he supposedly misled voters about the size of the budget deficit.  Yep.  That has never happened before, and not only should Davis be recalled, but he should get the same punishment as all those Enron felons (what?  They havent been punished yet?  Oh.).  At last count, there are almost 200 candidates on the ballot.  The early favorite:  Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Now, I have to give Arnold props.  He has been politically active, and is not running without any experience at all.  He is a Republican, but he is married to a Democrat, so that makes him relatively trustworthy.  I think he would make a fine governor; I don't want to use this blog to put down Arnold.    But I do want to say that what ails California is not going to be solved by selecting a new Governor.  California is either the most populous state or very nearly the most populous state.  They had a thriving (even if overvalued) dot.com based economy that came crashing back to earth along with the Nasdaq.  Silicon Valley is a shadow of its former self as the tech boom has settled a bit and other parts of the country have become technology headquarters too (see, e.g. Boston, Austin and Fargo).    Homeland security obligations and a weak national economy, factors that have sent almost every state into budgetary chaos, are particularly acute in California because it is so big (both in terms of geographical reach and in terms of population).  California has a number of potential terrorism targets to defend (including a large number of hospitals that require overhauling to meet potential chemical and biological threats).    California was creamed by energy deregulation and by crooked energy execs and perhaps it can be said that Davis could have handled all that better.  However, given a chance to oust him in November, voters declined to do so.  Add to all that the fact that diminished Federal support to states (which allows us to fund the war against Iraq to the tune of $4,000,000,000 per month) particularly harms California.  Also, in California, as in most states, the Governor is only as good as the legislation that reaches his desk.  One could argue that Gray Davis should have been a more effective leader in the legislature, but let me make this one bet:  whoever takes over will not resolve the budget crisis in California.  The crisis is bigger than one person and requires resolution of issues outside of California.  In my view, states run just like households:  in order to decrease debt, you need to do one of three things:  1.  decrease spending, 2.  increase income, or  3.  both  Oh, one other thing, the second option has to be done without increasing taxes.  So, short of more financial support from the federal government, the only realistic options are all political suicide (what politician in his right mind is going to increase taxes today?  A politician can only cut spending so far, before he gets blamed for every problem from bad roads to poor schools to increased crime.  A governor needs a legislature to do anything anyway).    The only justice to come out of the whole scenario is that Darrell Issa, the gentleman who funded the whole thing so that he could take over when Davis was recalled, had to end his candidacy when Arnold threw his hat into the (overcrowded) ring.  [BTW:  Issa made his fortune selling car alarms, so if you need another reason to question his judgment, there it is.]  Issa spent a couple million financing a fiasco for his own personal gain, only to leave chaos behind and force himself to make a tearful speech about how he wasn't going to be able to reap the benefits of his self-motivated effort to place his will over the will of the voters.     The only question that remains to be answered is:  who will reap the benefits?  Not California, and not any state that follows its lead by allowing partisan politics to usurp the democrat process.  Californians, you elected a Governor less than a year ago.  You have a legislature.  You have a voice.  Use them.  Dont recall Governor Davis.             "

I realize that liver can't be the best anyhow because it is the body's filter, and organ meat isn't good for your heart.  I don't like the smell of eggs and ketchup together. My husband likes to eat scrambled eggs with ketchup on them, yucky!  I can eat ketchup, but it is not my favorite thing.  Peanut butter and bologna sandwiches just don't taste right, and peanut butter and dill pickles aren't too great either.  I love to eat bread with peanut butter along with a bowl of chili, and I do know some other people who like the same.  Things with a lot of vinegar give me heartburn  Miracle whip is not mayonnaise.  Really rich and sweet stuff turns my stomach, I think it is in fact the richness of it and not the sweetness.  I know someone that won't eat anything that doesn't 'look good', I eat most things, looking good or not, and I never refuse free food.  I also know someone that won't eat mushrooms because they grow in manure, if she only knew how many things are grown in manure, she would probably starve to death. I believe she drinks, and most things with alcohol are the result of yeast eating the sugars, the alcohol is like the yeast's excrement, a by product of the yeast (little living creatures) after it has digested the sugars, it's waste, so to speak.  Personally I am game to try anything, once. If I don't like it, then I may not eat it again.  I did try head cheese, and didn't like it, something about the texture, I gave it to my cat and he didn't like it either. Later in life I worked in a deli, and used to slice head cheese, did you know that because of the rubbery texture it actually squeals on the slicer. And it smells bad.  I had a customer how she wanted the head cheese sliced, once upon a time, she said about an inch thick, so I had to ask her how she could eat it, she said she liked it with lots of salt.    And I don't eat salt on much of anything, because I feel that you can't taste what you are eating if you use salt.    Eggs are great with a soft yolk, a little bit of 'snot', (unofficially still clear albumen), along side toast (almost burnt) with butter and a lot of crispy bacon.  I do think that anything, if prepared right is good, and I will eat anything that is tasty. I really prefer things that aren't sweet, I like meats, vegetables, breads, cereals, anything to drink, chocolate, and fruits.  so what do you like??? input would be appreciated.............

1103575,female,indUnk,"       HAPPY BIRTHDAY KATE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We had fun.  We went to Town Center and I bought Kate a shirt that said spin my driedel (lol)  and I bought me a new ring, and got yelled at for wearing it upside down...  long story...  don't ask.  Then we went bowling and scored like a 57 or something.  My name also changed several times through out the night  i started out rae rae, but then I was Poke (seriously, this 'let's watch Rachel cringe and laugh at her hysterically' thing is REALLY not funny.)  and then later it something else, and then VVVVVVVVVVVVV m...  again, don't ask.  Sama was having control issues with the computer, hah a We went back to Kate's house after that and watched 10 things I hate about you (one of my favorite movies, aaaaahhhh  Heath Ledger...  HOTTIE!!) and a Walk to Remember, and guess what, a TEAR ACTUALLY ROLLED DOWN MY CHEEK!!!  what is that, the first time since HYU? and I'm not even gonna go into what happened this morning,   I don't even really know, i just woke up with Chantele sitting on me, grinning evily, holding my cell phone...

4192173,male,Technology,"             I'm still digging the Ryan Adams album immensely to the point where it's taking me time to get focused on the new Cure album. Upon the first few listens, I'm really liking the songs and the band sounds really inspired and motivated. In particular, Mr. Smith is pissed as hell on this record. I like that. However, I think the production blows, the mixing is flat and the severe raping of the defining Simon Gallup bass tone severly damages this album for me. I have a feeling that after seeing them perform these songs live at the end of next month I will appreciate them more. While I love the influence the producer has had on the band in terms of writing and performance, I think he should have stayed far away from the mixing.  Since you last read me, I have been spending signficant time between both of my bands. For the aggression, I solidified the tracklisting for the album and it will truly complete that era of music. I then proceeded to go hogwild (heheh) and do 95% of the artwork for it. The front cover is something I have been dying to commit to CD for some time, It's a photo of Iceland at night (taken by Brandt), but I'm just waiting on a few fonts to get it totally into shape. Thanks to Leo, I have all the fonts from FLOOD, so there will be continuity from the previous full length (Similar to the first two aggression CD's). I'll post the cover when it's done.  Meanwhile, check out www.theaggression.com for details on the new album as well an update on what the various members who DON'T post on this Blog are up to.  As for Hypefactor, Brandt and I took another stab at 1956 on Monday. We cracked it even further. Usually I would think at this point we are overthinking the song, but in reality the song needs this work and it's becoming more organic as we progress. This time, Brandt finally had the live drums ready to play with the song and Robin is so fierce on it that we dropped another load of loops out of the song. Like I said, organic. Thanks to those new guitar parts from Leo, the vocal melodies need to totally change. Thats my next assignment. B did a really cool rough mix for me to take along so I'm at work as we speak!  I've started to give friends and family a sneak peak at the material and the response has been very strong, I'm happy to say.  I gave Almost Bar Fighter Dan Hamill a sneak preview and he was impressed and very complimentary. He's probably my biggest litmus test of music outside the musical core. Because he is not a musican (he is a stage actor), he represents 'the people'...I think.  In the meantime, the THIRD band I have had the pleasure of being associated with has a nice review in Outburn this month and a good interview with Mr. Louche himself. Read it HERE: http://trixvintage.com/outburnchemlab.jpg (Thanks to whoever posted it on the Cracknation site).  On deck this week is seeing SPIDERMAN 2 tomorrow night. Then, we have a gathering of the Factor Corp. principles (Brandt, Ash, Robin, myself and now Charles) scheduled for Thursday night to review everything. Hopfully no one will flake because I really want all of these people in a room asap. All that's left is the vocals for 1956 and Peterface. The light at the end of the tunnel grows brighter.

2821801,female,indUnk,"           Went with my buddy (early in the summer) to rent a couple movies down by his place.  He said he had some late fees on his card (warning sign #1) so could we use mine.  OK, but I made him promise me he'd return them.  Done, no big deal.  About a MONTH later, I start getting calls from Blockbuster that I owe them like $80, from their Newport Beach store.   >  Guess who was resposnsible for that?  Kid never returned the movies.    After playing the blame game for a day or two, with him trying to shift responsibility to his brother, I eventually got him to (supposedly) pay the late fees.  It would appear this event is over.  Then the mail came yesterday.  Wouldn't you know 'Credit Protection Association, L.P.' sent me an official looking letter, informing me that my account is past due $36.98.  Effing wonderful.  I guess the process is for me to call the store directly, confirm my 'friend' DID ever pay ANY late fee.  Then take it from there.   How lame.  How utterly lame.         "

Situations have come and gone, but I've kept my cool and stayed the same. Bonds have broken, been fixed and broken again. But we're on a road of empires and things like that just take it's tole. Things have happened in my life these past 3 months that will mean more to me than I ever know now. Grandma dying, Break-Ups, Make-Ups and Shake ups, and I realized that some friendships are no longer there. But I guess this is just the cycle that I fell into, and not by option.  I have also been trying to figure out what people dont like about me. I've asked my camarades what they think. But they havent been able to come up with anything.  I know Im not a perfect sociable being. Something must be wrong. Im also in search of something. Something I honestly dont think Ill be able to find. I still have attachments to a certian person, and I have been trying to keep it a secret, but people are catching on. If they catch on to anything, its not Algebra, or Science, but who you have feelings for. I can't help it. I dont know what it is. I've tried everything. Like having feelings for someone new, thinking about all of these horible things they never even did, and such..but it doesnt work! It makes me so aggravated. Especially when you tell someone who you think you can trust, and it turns out to be someone who can't keep there mouth shut. Not mentioing any names or anything.  But with all of this I've decided to use the energy for a greater good. Like studying and reading Manga. Yes, you read correctly..m-a-n-g-a. That thing also known as anime. Its awesome, Im reading Love Hina, and .Hack\\Legend of the Twilight. Well, its Harry's Love Hina, but the other one is mine. Things are definitly changing and I have no clue about what to do.

589736,male,Technology,"           I have mixed feelings about the death penalty.  There's the part of me that says if it were MY family member/spouse/lover/friend murdered so horribly, I would want swift, brutal, American-style justice.  But I don't really believe that.  I don't feel that I, as a human with such limited understanding of the nature of life and existence, have the power or right to decide who lives and who dies - nor do I WANT that responsibility.  A friend of mine related a story to me once.  One teenaged boy had been killed by another, intentionally and doubtlessly.  The state was attempting to get the death penalty, but the mother of the victim fought against it, saying, 'Why should two mothers have to lose their sons?'    Food for thought.  Speaking of which, I'm REALLY hungry...         "

Whether it be a DVD, music, vids, or anything else that I really don't need, I'm a junkie.  Everytime I walk through a store, I'm making a mental list in my head of all the crap I want to buy.  It's a sickness, I'm sure.   2. What was the last thing you purchased?    Well, I just put a bid in for the Johnny Cash autobiography in hardcover.  Does that count?  That was like an hour ago...    3. Do you prefer shopping online or at an actual store? Why?    This is a tough one for me.  I like the convenience of shopping online, as I can't stand crowds and stupid people walking slowly in front of my.  I also like getting a 'parcel' in the mail, which is another benefit to shopping online.  The only thing that bugs me is that I want my product NOW.  Having to wait is the worst.  Literally, it'll ruin my day if I'm SURE my package will be there and it's not.  Yeah...I know.  I'm goddamn weird.   4. Did you get an allowance as a child? How much was it?    I seem to remember like a $1.00 a week.  But we had to earn it, yo.  Make our beds, keep our rooms tip-top.  I think I saved my money for toys and my brother would spend it right away on candy.  He'd get pissed when I'd buy a Star Wars figure and he'd be ass out.  I wish I could save my money like that now.   5. What was the last thing you regret purchasing?    I got a stupid back-massager thing for my chair here at work.  See, I jacked my back on Thursday night and I needed a quick-fix before my big firefighter test yesterday.  It was like $40 and I ended up slamming the remote control in the door.  So, I did what anyone else would do:  After my back felt better,  I returned it and got a full refund.  It was seriously a piece of shit, though.  (Panda: If you aren't locked in for insurance yet, you should let me know.  Our State Farm agent is good quality and he's cheap.)               "

Surely some revelation is at hand; Surely the Second Coming is at hand. The Second Coming!

I think certain albums hit you because of the timing in when you listen to them.  Beck was talking about breaking up, I was breaking up...it just made sense.  On the whole, this is a pretty sophisticated album for him.  I never thought he'd ever break away from the 'I'm a Loser' genre...this album proves he has.  If you like a softer edge, more intelligent lyrics, more melodic vs. noise, you'll like it. Very well crafted.    Elvis #1 Hits  On the other end of the spectrum...if 'Little Less Conversation' doesn't make you want to dance around, then you must be in a coma.  Good ol' rock n' roll mixed with some sappy ballads.  The best single disc Elvis primer to date.   Doves  - The Last Broadcast The perfect album for all you Jeff Buckley, Coldplay, Radiohead, or Wilco fans out there.  This album is lush, melodic, poignant and cohesive. This was my first introduction to the Doves - having listened to this British album for the first time a few weeks ago in London, I immediately downloaded as much of their stuff as I could find after I got home.  Beautiful and different...impressive!              "

2012853,female,indUnk,"       HiHi! Basically, I have to write something because I have been soooo darned lazy these past few months and my friend emailed me to say she'd be checking (how boring, Sorry Charmaine!)  She just told me she wouldn't be back for another 18 months, which I suspected because I think that London might be a little like KL, it sounds really fun and a lot of people that go there spend a longer time there than they thought they would.. my unlce spent 12 yrs there and he was supposed to study only!!  Plus its good money and travel prospects everything being so close and all. So this is essential to our keeping in touch..   The last few months, ok three (? i think) have gone past very quickly. I've been away from Sydney and my life here for 9 weeks and  it felt so  goood ...  I love travelling and seeing new things. Coming back has been a little hard actually, because it means i have to do things and get back 'on the ball'... just litle things, like the pile of mail, were hard to deal with, i open it, look at it, then put it back down.. have become really lazy and non correspondive (i know its not a word but ya know).. but the good news is that things are happening slowly. I have cleaned out my wardrobe and am proud to say I am up to date!! I threw away so much stuff I was ruthless!!  On the return journey I got sick, and got a cold so thats also why i haven't been doing anything, - the cold got pretty bad and i just lay in bed for a couple of days with jet lag and the fluey cold feeling of fuzziness.. then it turned into a bronchial cough, which i still have at times...   But about KL, I love it. Thats where I went and spent my time, with my family (aunties and cousins and uncles..) ..The shopping is awesome, and the food is also great. Its like they are more on par with America in some ways - just the franchise chain stores they have there are really American, like hot dogs, pretzels (we have those here i know) and others (they had this one where you could get a pizza flavoured crepe or banana peanut butter crepe all folded over and it was great! really crispy!)  Also the supermarkets are huge!! and the mallssssssss!!   But the funny thing is my cousins seem to be at that age (puberty  - all between 10-20) where they think they are doing everything right but they are really just being strange and silly! And Jay and I saw straight through them - don't know if its about the down to earthness of Australia or just my family..  Being back is a little tiring, cause I know that its back to the daily grind, wish I could escape and run away!!  Haven't worked much at all, both my workplaces seem to not have any work - its quite at TT and DM has already rostered everything up until March-  so have been trying to fill the 3 days i have off per week this session. By chance, got a  job interview  tomorrow with the firm my cousin is presently working for, so feeling abit nervous about it. Its a law firm so I am not exactly feeling confident.. and uni is finishing soon (6 mths) and then who knows?!... its just for more rounded work experience than customer service is all. Gotta try it...Can only try..   Anyway, thats all for now, sorry its so boring!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Hehehehe catch up more soon...             "

3543191,male,Student,"           Ouch! Had 3 accidents recently. First one was during PE lesson. When we were runnin, a friend unintentionally kicked my foot from behind, causing me to trip over another friend's foot and fall on my  left  side.Had a few scratches on the area just  left  of my knee. other than that i was alright and carried on running. Second one was when we were in the IT Room having CD. Me and two of mah peeps couldn't find anymore chairs, so we decided to use broken ones instead. The only problem about these chairs was that their back cushion could not stand up. I stupidly tried to fix it and ended getting my  left  thumb scratched by some metal part below the chair. Man, it was a quite a bad cut. Skin peeled off and a few minor scratches surrounded the more serious ones. Lost quite some blood too. Washed the wound before going down to the genral office to get it bandaged. Accompanying was Weiliang or Mr. Welfare. He helped the office staff in applying anticeptic and the bandaging process. Very thankful of him for that. The last injury happened just today. We were in the hall preparing for the Racial Harmony skit. Me and some others were kicking a soccer ball all over the house when i accidentally slided on the ball (opps!) and fell on my  left  side! My  left  arm was knocked real hard and the pain lingered long after the impact. It was so painful that i thought i broke my arm. The real point is that what's with my left side????

I know, I know, at this point you're wondering - How can a club be both hot AND cold?  Well, my friends, I'm going to be honest - I don't really get it either.  But it has something to do with liquid nitrogen and a temperature drop of about 30 degrees.  Just don't tell my parents where we're going as I'm sure they'd be concerned that the sudden change in temperature will cause us all to catch cold.   My mom has already begun bombarding me with her now infamous 'Don't set your drink down' (DSYDD) speech.

How I woke up in the mornings with a horrible sickening lump in my stomach... how every day I wished that I didn't have to get up, that I could just stay there and not have to deal with the world, and the people in it.  I kept promising myself that if I just stuck it through that eventually everything would be all right.  I had dreams of someday so distant that I knew they wouldn't come true.  I was suffocating, drowning, dying away. but then somewhere I found the strength to swim to shore, I was safe again.  and I'm so happy now, I love how things are now.

3022585,female,Education,"       When I checked the mail one day last week and saw the oversized, cream envelope with my name and address perfectly printed on it, I thought 'Oh hell, here's another one.'  I open it to find an invitation to a cousin's wedding in May.  As I scan the card for the wedding, the reception, the directions, and the reply card I think, 'And so the season begins.'  Every year there is a flow of weddings in my life.  I have probably been to at least 50 weddings since I was small.  Since college, they just keep on coming.  Someone told me that there is usually a boom right after college and then again in your 30s.  Um, there has been no let up in the bombing, apparently the troops refuse to surrender, give up and just go home.  I do have to say that I sometimes, am on the firing squad, well in some capacity anyway.  This year marks the seventh run as a bridesmaid for me  (OK, so 2 of them were my brothers, but still 7, come on people).  That's right, seventh (this does not include the ones in which I will merely be a spectator).  I love my friends and family and am so honored to be included in these special days and this is no diss on them in anyway.  This is all about me.  I mean, it's always about me anyway, right?    This year are the weddings of 2 very special people, my cousin who is like a sister to me and my best friend who basically is a sister to me.  These are probably the most special ones that I will be a part of and in my best friend's I am the maid of honor.  When she asked me, I cried, and then reality set in, this is my 7th time walking down the aisle, alone.  Oh, there are no pitty parties, Anna is an independent.  One friend said, 'Well, at least you're getting closer.'  I was like, um thanks, that's as close as I want to be, for now anyway.  So, I do my duties of planning and attending showers, giving my measurements to strangers (probably the worst part of the whole process), and being there for the bride in any way she might need.  I do all of this thinking, as Cinderfuckinrella (thanks Pretty Woman) did, that someday my prince will come.  But, oh no, don't think he needs to rescue me, no.  I've already rescued myself.  I want a prince for all the other reasons, plenty of cash, big house, private jet.  No, really, I want a prince who is prince of humanity in that he treats me and everyone I love with kindness, who is so funny that I laugh out loud just thinking about things he has done or said, who wants to learn to do things that I love just because I love them, and who wants me to do the same for him.  I think my friends (and cousin) have found these princes, I know they have.  I'm just hoping that they haven't gotten the last ones.          "
1463590,female,Education,"                 Mood: sad and a little  upset.     urlLink I got to this page  because it was written on a buddys shirt in the Penny Arcade comic today.  Totally random thing to do really.  Then I clicked on the birds and the bees story, which is what the link goes to directly.  I read the whole thing, all the time thinking it must be a kind of satire or SOME kind of joke.  No such luck.  I'm sure the author would say that letting our children think being gay is O.K. is not a topic to joke about.   Sometimes, over here, when Sonia sees something on the news about America that shows something with a Bush view on it, she says she's kinda embarrassed to be American at that moment.   I'm not christian, but I am human, and this man makes me embarrassed for the human race.  It's a book, just because it's a very OLD book written when it was very common for scholars to take hallucinogens does not make it unquestionable.  That's pointless logic though because it's the type of thing that a person has to accept to believe and the people who would benefit from it the most are unacceptable to it.  It's a tough thing living on this planet with so many different people.  Each one seems to think that it's not enough to hold an opinion. They feel that that convincing someone else will justify their stance more.  It would be so nice if people would have the faith in themselves to hold their opinions and truly not care what others think.  So many people say that they are that way, but if they are then why are they trying to change my thinking?  It's not just about holding your own under fire, its about not firing on others as well.     I was thinking though, like that kids in the comic; people have to get their ideas from somewhere.  They are socially constructed.  Plus, once they have them, i would be folly to have them set in stone.  New ideas should be reviewed and judged on their own merits.  Unfortuatly, most new ideas get judged on whether or not they will suposrt that person's existing ideas, which is quite the same as having them set in stone.   I'm just trying to live in this world.  I'm not smarter than many, and no, your probably not more or less intelligent than me by any great extent.  Don't quote IQs at me, IQ isn't realism, or emotional sense. So many, many people who think that their particular education and personality makes them smarter. Everyone of those people will ignore a statement like that as well, maybe they don't think I'm intelligent enough to criticize them, they who KNOW what's right.  Just like the man behind that page. If you could live in someone else's head for a bit, I bet you'd be surprised to find out they're NOT beneath you.  They are a smart and reasoning human being with reasons for everything. If you fail to recognize that, then how smart are you?   I believe that man is wrong, with all my heart. He can have his opinion, he can even believe that printing anti-gay pamphlets is the right thing to do.  I'll still sit her and be sad for him.  We can all only live as ourselves.       "

Nothing will quench its flame...  nothing will quench its flame.  kiss me, my love that your name be on my lips. You intoxicate my being with the fragrance of your presence.   How beautiful you are my darling.  Show me your face, let me hear your voice.   Sweet as the dew in the early morn, like a lily among the thorns.  I looked for you, the one my heart lovew.  I looked for you, but did not find you.  I searched through the night until I rested in your sight.  NOw I will never let you go.   You have stolen my heart, my sister, my bride, you have stolen my hear with one glance of your eyes.    Your lips are so sweet, adorned with honey.  My hands, they drip with myrrh.  Set me as a seal on your heart, set me as a seal on your soul.  For strong as death is love, unyielding as the grave.   Nothing will quench its flame.    I actually got to talk to Matt Maher at NCYC... which was really cool, and I told him I absolutely loved this song, and he explained to me that its not just about a boy and a girl, its actually about the relationship between God and the Church/his people, which I thought was amazing...  I've listened to this song like five times today... the harmonies are stuck in my head.  oh well.      "

2844168,female,Marketing,"                  Alright, already! I'm here!   Wow! I miss one day and I get scolded for being lazy! You know who you are, big dog!! =) Just teasin ya. It's nice to know you're reading. Ok, so I'm back. I'm still sniffling and coughing, but I'm on the mend! In fact yesterday I thought I was all better, but this morning I woke up miserable again. It's crazy.  Due to my lovely sniffles I've been taking it fairly easy this week. My current writing assignment is to write vivid observations using each of my five senses. Yesterday after a nice cool rain, I decided to sit on the porch and describe the fresh, after-rain smell. Well, I walked onto the porch and realized, 'what am I thinking? I can't smell anything!!' I guess that assignment will have to wait until next week!  Sometimes honesty costs. I went in today to get my address corrected on my driver's license. When we first moved here I was getting the numbers in our address all mixed up. By the time I got myself unconfused, I realized the address on my license was wrong. I went in today to get it corrected and when I told the gentleman at the counter the correct address, he asked, 'was this just a typo or did you move?' I thought for half a second that if I told him it was a typo I could probably save myself the cost of getting it changed ($10!!). But I knew that I had given it to them wrong the first time, but they would never know. But I would know. So I told him 'When we first moved I kept getting the numbers mixed up, and I'm sure I gave it to you wrong.' He just peered at me over his glasses  with funny look and then said 'that will be $10.' I suppose that $10 is worth having a clean conscience and a good night's sleep.  While I've been nursing my sniffles the past couple days, I've indulged myself by scrapbooking. I'm working on finishing up the pictures from our  urlLink Alaska trip  last August. That trip seems like such a long time ago! We came back from that trip, turned in our two weeks notices and moved three weeks later. With all that flurry of activity, we really didn't have time to reflect much on our trip after we returned. It's been so much fun to relive those memories as I've scrapbooked the pictures. It makes me want to go on another adventure!! Ked and I LOVE traveling together. There's nothing like bonding as you end up in all these fun and unusual circumstances together. You just never know what or who you'll encounter, like the time we stood up in 2 complete strangers' wedding in South Dakota. Ahh... I'll save that one for another day...to keep you coming back for more!!! =)  Later!               "

3309662,male,Internet,"       I've decided to document my little adventure in America.  My previous attempt at a blog ( urlLink http://adam.killingmachines.org ) has fallen by the wayside somewhat, but I think with some of Blogger's extra features, I should be able to rectify that situation. Besides all that - it will give me somewhere to moan about the red tape infested wold you end up in when you immigrate into the US these days.  Anyways, on with the blogging - after nearly 6 weeks in the country I finally have a new place to live - right next to Reston town center. The rent is reasonable and the big bonus is that I'm within walking distance of the job, which is good given how hard it is to get a drivers license in the state of Virginia when you were born outside the US.  Go take a look at the  urlLink requirements (pdf)  for yourself and try to figure out how many of those documents you might have. It turns out that the only thing I can use to prove my identity besides my passport is the I-797 form I got when applying for my Visa. Not too bad you might think, but then I applied for the Visa in January, so my memory of forms I obtained is a little hazy. It was only when I got desparate and started Googling every form listed on the sheet to see if I could get one that I found out I had the I-797 already. Once I get the learner's permit it's just 30 days until I can take the test - that should be just in time for delivery of the new car :)  Other than that things have been going pretty well. I'm finally going to learn PERL tomorrow - properly this time too - not my usual half assed attempt - the company are paying for an intensive 3 day advanced course - it would be nice to know at least one programming language properly.  Most importantly, my lovely (and far too good for me) girlfriend is visiting in a couple of weeks - all I have to do now is make sure there are things like a bed, chairs, tables in the new place before she comes. Another trip to IKEA is needed methinks.....  That's enough for now - more when I get bored :)         "

3568056,male,Sports-Recreation,"           last night saw quite a few outstanding performances by pitchers.  i will go over a few of them as well as give my thoughts on some pitching matchups today.  my family drove to my grandparents' house in virginia beach last night and today, so i will be there for the week.  the 11-hour drive wears on you a bit, but i am recovering now.  so here you are: last night: ben sheets Mil: he turned in the performance of the night and left w/ a ND.  9 innings of 1-hit scoreless ball, but the game went to 15 i believe.  no walks and 5 K as well.  he seems to have fully recovered from the dizziness that made him miss his last start pedro martinez Bos: a great outing in an inconsistent year, he got a W for 8 innings of scoreless 2-hit pitching.  walked 2 and 8 Ks as well. this is in stark contrast to last outing where he gave up 7 ER and 11 hits in 5 IP. i am of the opinion that his ship has been righted for this season (yes i am reversing field from yesterday, i can do that) zack greinke KC: got the win after 7 innings of scoreless 3-hit ball w/ 5 K and no walks. although pitching v. the expos didnt hurt his stats, he has quietly put together a solid year.  he is 1-1 in 4 starts, w/ an ERA of 1.73 over 26 innings (6.5 per start).  a good option for AL only leagues or if youre low on $.  3-1 K-BB ratio looks pretty good also. kelvim escobar Tor: if you want to talk about hot, heres your man.  last 2 outings, he has been 1-0 with 1 ER over 16 innings.  last night he got a ND after 8 innings of scoreless 4-hit ball, including 11 K. 4-2 on the season, 3.34 ERA, and 54-20 K-BB, another good AL-only pickup. he seems to be settling in as a starter after being a reliever 2 yrs ago. randy johnson Ari: big unit rebounded from an average performance last outing, notching a W on 1 run, 3 hits in 7 IP.  only 4 K, but he has been 5-0 beginning w/ the perfect game. 8-4, 2.75 on the season, and is averaging nearly 7 IP per start. other notable performances came from Roger Clemens (0 ER, 3 H, 6.2 IP, 6 BB, 7 K, W), Javier Vazquez (1 ER, 5 H, 7 IP, 0 BB, 6 K, W), Matt Clement (3 ER, 5 H, 8 IP, 1 BB, 9 K, W), as well as Jerome Williams and Ted Lilly. today's games: since i just now have gotten access to a computer, i already know what happened to mark prior today.  after a solid 1st outing, he struggled against st louis.  he went 3.2 innings and gave up 5 ER on 5 hits and 5 BB.  he struck out 1.  he threw 83 pitches, 49 for strikes.  edgar renteria hit a GS in the 4th to knock him out.  as i said yesterday, i would give him another start or 2 to make sure he has recovered (i have to emphasize it when i get something right). other pitchers to look for today would be: b. lawrence SD: although he is pitching against a solid boston lineup, the padres have given him plenty of run support.  last start was solid (1 ER, 5 H, 7.1 IP), and i would look for a performance slightly below that today (this is definitely a limb i am going out on, but he doesnt usually walk many) k. brown NYY: he has been concerned w/ hes control lately, but his walk numbers are very low (17 BB in 78.2 IP). his last start was mediocre, but he is 7-1 on the season.  i would look for another 7 IP, 3 ER and a win from him. j. schmidt SF: after 2 opening losses, 7-0 with a 1-hitter.  last 2 starts have been 2-0 with 14 IP, 3 ER, 7 H, 20 K, and 5 BB.  pitching at TB shouldnt bring him any problems. this is as close to a lock as you can get, i would think. e. milton Phi: another relative unknown i am fond of.  7-1, 3.78 season. last 2 starts, he is 2-0 w/ 14 IP, 2 ER, 8 H, 8 K, and 5 BB.  the white sox offense has been solid this yr, but maggs is out, so milton should have a good start and i believe he should get a W.  that is your wednesday pitcher update. tomorrow we will cover hitters.  feel free to post any feedback whatsoever.  i hope you can find this helpful and enjoyable. have a good one!

3568056,male,Sports-Recreation,"           wow i almost forgot about this...but dont fear.&nbsp; hmm this list will be spontaneous...thinking.&nbsp; here we go.&nbsp; this kind of sucks, but its all i can come up with at this time.&nbsp; this weeks top 5 category is: &nbsp; places i would most like to live post-college: &nbsp; 5.&nbsp;hmm...i do these in reverse order, so this is tough...ha, heres an interesting one.&nbsp; london.&nbsp; i think it would be interesting to see how different life is over there.&nbsp; that is the one foreign country i would most like to visit, and my friend said the ladies enjoy american accents :) . i would definitely have to visit there before i decided to live there though.&nbsp; its intriguing nonetheless. &nbsp; 4. boston- i am running out of ideas, but i liked the city.&nbsp; this would probably mean that i ended up going to mit or harvard, which is fine (although im not too big on harvard).&nbsp; i enjoy snow&nbsp;and cold, so i would be at home there.&nbsp; the negatives are that the natives dont seem particularly friendly, and nobody cares about college football there (ooh, boston college...ha!) i guess #1 has a similar dilemma though...boston is a nice enough city &nbsp; 3. columbus oh- although its kind of boring, there are much worse.&nbsp; i am quite used to it, and its a pretty affordable place to live.&nbsp; then you have the buckeyes and the central location of the vaunted buckeye nation (it seems like every other car has a bumper sticker or vanity plate or flag for osu...its awesome!).&nbsp; i would like to have some space from my family though. &nbsp; 2. chicago- i almost liked this as much as #1 (see that shortly), but i didnt get to see much of it, so im not positive.&nbsp; the area on lake shore drive was gorgeous though.&nbsp; plus a great sports town (always a plus :) ) &nbsp; 1. nyc (manhattan preferably)- i went there this spring break, and my visit only made me more enamored of the city than what i had been before.&nbsp; in addition to being the 'financial capital of the world' which is kind of my desired career area right now (yes its not terribly exciting, but i find it interesting) its like the citys generators could cut out and the city would still run bc there is so much energy there, if that makes sense.&nbsp; it was awesome, and i would love to live there (although not cheap i would guess).&nbsp; sidenote: i was there the day before the NIT final which michigan was in.&nbsp; when i was walking around times sq i saw 3 tall guys in michigan warmups, so im guessing they were on the basketball team.&nbsp; i wanted to get a pic of the 4 of us holding up our arms like 'O-H-I-O', but i kind of wussed out.&nbsp; but i did see them (i think one was courtney sims, very good soph center/forward/not sure).&nbsp; so you can see famousish people there too :) &nbsp; as you can probably see, i would like to live in a big city.&nbsp; i just find small towns kind of depressing bc there seems to be no variety in the life there.&nbsp; it strikes me as a lack of progress, which is something that scares me, in any form.&nbsp; i know that every place has its own advantages, and i have nothing against small towns, they just dont seem to be for me (watch as i end up living in one for the rest of my life).&nbsp; to each his (or her for those that are politically correctly? inclined) own, right?

3932072,female,indUnk,"                 you know you're pathetic when. yesterday, I was doing dishes at Gator's house while dogsitting (she's in Vancouver with her Mom; it's Mom month for her), and I absolutely could NOT open the cap of the dish detergent!  it was so sad!  You'd think that 'SQUEEZE CAP SIDES' is pretty straight forward, but noooo, simple child safety features confound Pinto the Stupid.  lovely. so at this point, I am completely superfluous in every sense of the word.  The only thing I can do ever is finish my laundry so I can pack.  Sux0r.  I'm heading up to Gator's later with Mom to walk her dogs, and spend some time with them, and feed them and stuff, and then I have to finish up some last minute shopping.  I need to find new boots from Value Village.  Mine are completely falling apart.  I also have to get some sleeper earrings, and maybe more sex bracelets.  But I bought a new package yesterday at the mall when I bought my wedding jewelry, so I don't particularly need them.  I just found out that I'm leaving on the morning of the third which means no Laura p-tay for me!  Life sucks a LOT. well, I did a post yesterday but my idiot mom closed the window before I was finished without saving so I lost it all.  So I'll simply do yesterday's lists.  Yesterday...         i wore: denim shorts, and a big black tee that had a picture of Smurfs on it.         i ate: coffee, thai kitchen, and grape soda.  and burgers that made me nauseous in the middle of the night.         i did: some dogsitting, some reading, some shopping, some moping, some laundry.  exciting life, huh?         i like: my new jewelry.         i dislike: not having oodles of money.         brag moment: there wasn't one.  I did nothing extraordinary.         cringe moment: my unnatural unnatural demeanor around Jesse Janzen on the bus.  Now the entire world knows just how much of an awkward nerd-o I am.         here's a new one!          granola moment: folding laundry in the kitchen while being scrutinized by my big old dog.  How domestic.  (a granola moment is something that is refreshingly ordinary and nice and relaxing) so those were yesterday's lists.  I am not going to do my lists for today cause it's only ten in the morning, and nothing's happened yet.  so you are deprived.  *weep weep* anyway, laundry awaits. have fun blogging, bloggers.       "

Of course they have some pretty different ideas about human rights and the environment but I get the feeling that being in the public eye for so long, the throngs of adoring fans (well, in Kim's case adoring may be a stretch) and accompanying entourage/roadies may have made them both a little distant from work-a-day realities. At least Bono doesn't require visitors to put  urlLink flowers at the foot of massive statues of his father , though.   urlLink Here's an interesting story  that's sure to attract an obliquely-worded press release from the North.

Stupid Jason was sitting next to me the previous lesson doing the exact same thing and he got to go in. Again stupid Bennet. Spent the whole period in B8 doing shat all. Wasted second period.

What direction would you like to have your journal/blog go in over the next year?  Oh, we plan to blow up the spot, yo.  We are going to add photos and it's gonna be hard core.

1103575,female,indUnk,"       So, on suggestion of Brittany Cummings, I looked up Ricky Votolato on the internet.  This is what I found:  the days behind you are haunting / the ones your living in now / the ghost of your past carries / the weight of your name / where would you be who are you / without the scaring and the heals that stepped on you / that you cling to with all of your strength / let go - freefall - it's scary I know to forgive all of the devils / let go - i'll catch you / It's scary I know to understand what must be done  58 guthrie street / an old postcard you sent / to help close up wounds that I love to reopen / quarters in the tequila / on the streets of houston / you can keep on drinking / but never drown out where you've been / let go - freefall - it's scary I know to forgive all of the devils / let go - i'll catch you / It's scary I know to understand what must be done   there is a statesman servant beneath / the thick skin of remembering / armor for protection / let go - freefall - it's scary I know to forgive all of the devils / let go - i'll catch you / It's scary I know to understand what must be done  Tonight I went to reconciliation...  That's one of the things I love about Catholicism that a lot of people hate.  For me, it's something more than just being forgiven.  Its a reassurance that I'm loved.  Sure, I can lie awake in bed every night and say, 'Oh God, I'm sorry.  Please help me be better.  Please help me be patient, please help me not to judge, please help me understand that other people hurt as much as I do.  Help me heal other's wounds instead of cause them.  I'm sorry, please forgive me.  Help me not to do it again.'  But as much as I say those things, and as much as I know that God hears me and does help me, it feels wonderful to hear a person I know is of God say those words of absolution.  It makes it official somehow, and I feel renewed in God's love for me.  { loving and forgiving are you,  oh Lord, loving and forgiving are you }  and so every night, I fall asleep wrapped in arms of love.  Whose arms they are, I'm not sure, but they consist of love, and love is always of God.  So its ok. Love is of God, so its ok.     "

883178,male,Fashion,"            Does this happen to you?   In our cubicle culture, soemtimes people will come into my workstation, see that I am on the phone (I am always on the phone) and then have a seat.  I will sometimes stretch my arms out to let them know that I'm well hung...er...I mean...on a lengthy call, but there are a couple of thick customers who will just sit there anyway.  It's getting to where I think I should get some muzak and outdated magazines for my cubicle as waiting room ('Duf the hygienist will see you now, scrape, scrape - why don't you floss?' - but I digress).    So, what I do is hit my mute button, explain my sign language (universally known around the globe and the whole world over for'well hung' or 'long') and ask if I can check in with them when my call is done.  Today, in a stroke of pure dullness, one of our slower colleagues replied by saying 'oh, okay, it's not important, I'll check back with you later.'  Which begs three questions:  if it's not important, why didn't you leave when I flashed you the 'long' sign?  What the hell's the matter with you?

G. for short).&nbsp; Mel and Gareth and probably Barbara have one too.&nbsp; But I can't remember there's.&nbsp; Anyway we ate there, and had copious amounts of fun talking about scallop farming, and the aspirations of vegetables (I'm going to be a tomato!&nbsp; *hopeful face*).&nbsp; As we were waiting for our dessert (Sex in a Dinghy;&nbsp;NOT joking!), me and the girls invented this game called--um...wait, I can't remember what it was called.&nbsp; for the purposes of this blog we shall call it Tomato Toss.&nbsp; Cause that's what we were doing.&nbsp; We were passing a tomato back and forth using the coasters.&nbsp; That was incredibly infantile, and amusing.&nbsp; After that we clambered back aboard the boat, and sped our way around the island to the other side where there's this cove that's friends of Laura's family live on, and we swam off the boat there.&nbsp; We had this air mattress, and I kept falling off of it, and attempting to get back on to no avail.&nbsp; It was intensely amusing.&nbsp; Then we sang a few songs while sitting on the bow, which was intense fun, SERIOUSLY because I haven't sung with my girls for forever and a day.&nbsp; So we sang which was fun.&nbsp; Then, just as we started singing 'Do You Love Me',&nbsp; Gord started the boat and we did some more speeding around the islands.&nbsp; That was seriously hysterical, because we started screaming in excitement, but were still singing the song so it ended up being like, 'DO YOOOOU LOOOOOVE MEEE!'&nbsp; 'DOOO YOOOOUUU LOOOVE (ha ha ha!) MEEEEEE'&nbsp; 'DO YOU LOVE MEEE-EEE-EEE'&nbsp; 'DO YOOOOOOOOUUU (ack!) LOOOOOVE MEEEEE'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'DO YOU LOVE (ha ha!) ME (ha!)

We couldn't find a place to tie up, and eventually, harbour staff just let us double park somebody's boat.&nbsp; I felt really bad, cause we had to walk on the other person's boat to get to the dock.&nbsp; Then once back on the sea wall, we went to a cafe and bought ice cream.&nbsp; It was really really good ice cream.&nbsp; Finally Gord drove me home where I found that my Aunt who lives in Nova Scotia had sent me free makeup!&nbsp;&nbsp;yeah!&nbsp; I got mascara, lip glaze, lip chap, and nail polish.&nbsp; and my sister bought me my bus pass for next month.&nbsp; joy!

3581210,male,InvestmentBanking,"             One thing I love about Seoul (and I mean this about Korea in general...I just happen to be a little Seoul-centric) is the street sellers.  I don't really trust the food they sell on the side of the road (except ice cream) but virtually everything else is fair game for me.  For example, to get ready for my trip to Canada and generally stock up, in the last two weeks I bought:  2 plants in a can for my nieces (8,000 won) 2 lightweight sports shirts for inlining (10,000 won for both) 1 pair of shorts for inlining (20,000 won) 3 bags of dried 고구마 (goguma, sweet potatoes or yams, they were selling 1 for 3,000 won , 2 for 5,000 but I got 3 for 6,000) 1 tie (at an amazing price of 5,000 won, or USD 4...and I can't really tell how it's worse than the ones I bought for USD 100 back home.) 10 disposible razors (for 1,000 won, or USD 0.80 FOR ALL TEN) 1 noise-making toy hammer for boy #2 (1,000 won) 3 Disney photo albums (but I'm sure ol' Walt didn't make a penny on these....just 1,000 won each)  The clothes-seller guy spoke pretty good English...I know because he held my hostage for 5 minutes as we talked about how Korean men are getting fatter (hence his stock of larger sizes for husky guys like me) and how he learned English working for the US Army about 20-30 years ago.  The goguma-guy didn't know a lot of English, but he did speak Spanish owing to the fact that he lived in Argentina for a few years.  Unfortunately, Spanish is not one of my languages...I know a fair bit of French from my school-days, a smattering Japanese and, of course, some Korean. Anyways, when I passed the goguma-guy later in the week I gave him a big 'hola!' (Spanish for hello, and the extent of my proficiency) and he returned one as well...wow, bridging the cultures with another one...how UN of me.  Below is a picture of the famous Yeouido tie-truck.

3581210,male,InvestmentBanking,"             Yahoo! Finally, after being in Seoul for almost 2 years we closed our first deal. I had almost given up on this place/market, but looks like we've go our foot in the door. Never give up is the motto here. Reminds me of a client of mine I had in Vancouver. I knew he was quite wealthy and invested in my area, but it took 2 years to get an account out of him...for $500,000. He said to me three words I'll never forget: persistance beats resistance. Man, what a lesson that was.   A friend of mine from  urlLink Geoje-do  (cool blog about teaching experiences on Geoje-do  urlLink here ) came up this weekend with a couple of buds from the Island. One (Andy) has a friend in concert promotion and they had 2 VIP tickets to the  urlLink MTV Buzz Asia Concert  (sponsored by the super-cool  urlLink iriver  company-article  urlLink here ) at Chamshil Indoor Stadium (which I think is the same as the  urlLink Jamshil Auxiliary Stadium ). Thanks Andy!   I had no idea it would be so packed. We got there just after 7PM, when it started. We read the part on the ticket about first come/first served, but missed the line about 'doors will be open at 4pm'. Whoops (Koreans probably made a day out of it and came at noon, knowing them). Well, the place was full, but our VIP friends were already in. The gal (Anne) came out and (owing to her sister who works with the Prince tours showing her the tricks of the trade) she not only got us into the stadium but into basically any seating area that wasn't already full. Thanks Anne!   The acts were pretty cool. We missed the first one,  urlLink 보아/BoA  but caught the rest. Take a look at the pics below of BoA,  urlLink Jaurim  and  urlLink Shinhwa . For all the boy bands/acts I tried to get the most masculine pictures I could for my site, but if you want fruitier ones they're all over their sites. (I sometimes wonder about these guys, but at least the girls are hot.)    urlLink      BoA, Jaurim and Shinhwa.    There were a few J-Pop and Taiwanese acts too:  urlLink Namie Amuro ,  urlLink Vanness Wu  and  urlLink Wang Lee Hom . There were a couple of others, but the names were in Chinese and I'm feeling a little lazy now.    urlLink      Namie Amuri, Vanness Wu and Wang Lee Hom.    So, as you know, Koreans love to get together and eat and drink, that's why the after-party was so cool. It was in the uber-tony area of  urlLink Apkujungdong . It's home of the highest priced real estate (and women) in all of Korea. Yes, I'm sure I saw many genuine Fendi bags and plastic bodies. The best part was the 2 free drink tickets. Ah, there's the Scot in me speaking again. The next day we hung out in lovely  urlLink Yeouido Park  (another review  urlLink here ) where we fed the birds (below). It reminded me of the flocking to the afterparty/bar/dancefloor the night before...birds of a feather and all that.    urlLink      The gatherings: concert, afterparty, in the park.      urlLink Here's another flocking ...of Koreans to the beach in Pusan. I think the caption says there are 1,000,000 people there at the beach (about 2/3 of the population of the Vancouver area). I wouldn't put it past them.   And my final comment on this topic: credit cards.  urlLink This article  on how Koreans were lured by the notion of 'easy money/credit' (fanned somewhat by the card companies' desire for market share at any cost) and hwo it almost lead to suicide for these three individuals (sadly, many of also 'succeeded' in passing on their debts to their heirs, as happens here when a debtor dies).

3525620,male,Non-Profit,"       Today is a pretty average and mundane day.  These are usually the best days for me, because I 'zone out' and start daydreaming.  (Just a little sidenote), it's amazing how when I daydream, it's almost as if I'm not physically present where I am and then it takes an outside distraction to bring me back to where I am.  Some people may think that's weird, but I see it as an awesome way to escape the daily pressures of life, rather than doing something that may be harmful to me or someone else.  Also, what I've found to be the most beneficial is how I've been able to generate ideas, accomplish feats that I didn't know that I could and also, at times, live out my dreams.    However, something that I've learned recently that may end up being a quantum leap for my life is writing down my thoughts or dreams.  Being able to come back to a previous thought and refer back to it at a later time, perhaps after acquiring more knowledge and skill can be a very powerful combination.  That's really my whole point for establishing my blog.  I've come to the conclusion that if no one ever reads my blogs, but me, that's okay, because in doing this I'm benefiting in several ways.  Firstly, I'm establishing a habit in doing something that I enjoy, which is writing.  Secondly, I'm developing content that can be utilized later for something that maybe marketable.  Thirdly, I'm overcoming my apprehension of putting information out there for others.  I guess I've always felt that no one would really be interested in what I have to say anyway.  It's kind of ironic that I think that, because I love giving public speaking engagements and I love songwriting.  I guess I take writing and sharing my knowledge and experience as being something that is very personal or almost even sacred.  But what I've found, is that is what most people like about me.  My ability to express thoughts or experiences in such a way that they themselves feel like they're experiencing or thinking it.  One thing that I strive to do with my life, is to  do whatever I do with my heart and if I'm unable to do that then I quit and move on.          "

883178,male,Fashion,"           OK, here's the thing.  I can't say I liked this movie (critics be damned) although I do admit to liking the message and getting a good laugh.  Michael Moore takes risks.  Michael Moore is over-the-top.  Michael Moore is unabashedly biased, unsubtle, and hates G-Dub with all his heart.  Michael Moore has been blessed with the release of his film being impeccably timed.  He has also been blessed with getting his hands on some amazing live footage of the president, soldiers, and other politicians doing and saying some stupid, stupid things.  However, Michael Moore is not the greatest film-maker to ever live.  This is a film about a man who hates the current administration.  He is not offering solutions to the problem (i.e. - who would make a good replacement).  He is not apologizing for taking things out of context.  He is merely presenting his stream-of-consciousness ideologies.  Good ol' Mikey lost the focus in Fahrenheit 9/11 that he had captured in Bowling for Columbine.  He presents footage in a way that does not flow smoothly, and  IMHO, the film is at least 15 minutes too long.  If it wasn't for the comical music and his dubbed-over voice, I would have become bored during some parts.  I do recommend everyone (except for my father, a Vietnam veteran) go see it, but bring a barrel of salt with you.   ps - If I would have written a real review, it would have sounded something like  urlLink this .

2821801,female,indUnk,"           Friday night:  Got kinda drunk @ home Saturday AM:   urlLink Memorial mountain bike ride for Mark Reynolds , with over 800 other riders.  For those of you not in the know, he was a local rider killed by a mountain lion about 5-6 weeks ago.  The same mountain lion (a couple days later) dragged another woman about 100 yards, by her head.  Fortunately, she lived - due to the assistance of her friend and some other riders who happened to be in the area.  Within a week, the offending mountain lion was shot and killed by a posse of Park Rangers/Sheriffs.  In any case, got to go riding (and chat a little) with  urlLink Hans Rey ,  urlLink Leigh Donovan  (who I used to have a HUUGE crush on) and  urlLink Brian Lopes .  Saw Hans clear this 'un-rideable' section of trail - one of the nastiest, steepest, loosest climbs I've ever seen.  I'll see if I can get a pic next weekend.    The group I rode with had done a 90 minute ride prior to the 'group memorial ride',  as those things usually chug along, and all the slow people (who think they're fast) like to try and hang with the big dogs, but then just get run over on the first hill.  Bleh.  In any case, I joined up with the fast group at the back of the pack, got bored real quick, and bolted to the front.  Had to pass about (literally) 300 people, but eventually got there.  That's where I met up with Lopes and Hans, and hacked it a bit.  Net net net, about 3.5 hours of ride time, which lined me up for a good 3 hour post-ride nap.  My ass was kicked.

So heres my theory which a friend helped my write:        &nbsp;   What people now days call 'going out' means that you claim eachother and are temporarily stuck to somebody for usually a long period of time in which u probally decide you don't even like this person BUT you don't want to break things off because it would be too much of a mess. So going out is basically a pointless, rather stupid thing that ends in a mess. Dating, however, is so much better! When you date, you're not really making a commitment you're just having fun. And then if you decide you don't like the person then you just don't answer their calls and you move on! Man I give good advice!       &nbsp;     &nbsp;   On the dating subject- as I was goin to bed last night I was thinking about what kinda guy would be right for me and i came up with a list of some things i like in a guy and some things&nbsp;I don't like! So here it is:       &nbsp;   Top 5 things I like in a guy       &nbsp;   1.Funny!

3536864,male,Student,"       At first, I had attempted to write a poem, but I decided to leave that to people that are actually gifted.  I felt inspired yesterday when I saw the clouds rolling around, but today......I just don't have it.  But there are storms here.  Oh yes, storms a plenty. I have been driven to my storm shelter 4 times this year.  They call it Tornado Alley for a reason. As opposed to other places like 'Missouri, land of discovery' or something like that.  I can discover something in montanna if I wanted to. But I don't, so haha. If you think that was a bit odd, please read the disclaimer in small print at the top of the page.  Now you're going to look at the top of the page and see what it says.  I actually don't know that for sure; just a guess.  And this has gone all over the place.  Back to storms.  I love storms. Some people don't. I love the rain, the smell of the storm before it strikes, the color of the sky after the clear, sounds echoing throughout the entire enduring cell.  Lightning with flashes so bright that you are blinded in the darkness that surounds you created by the presence of the clouds. Other people that don't like storm are a bit odd to me.  Great way of displaying God's creation.   It's pitch black outside.  But you know what they say, it's always darkest right before it goes pitch black.  So now, I'll have to leave the rest of this space empty.....just like outside.....except outside it's black and not empty, and here it's black and empty.  So decided which one you want to believe.  Chaio!         "
883178,male,Fashion,"           Okay...I know some of you Pandy-ites love Bono, but this excerpt from an article (sent in by Moses Oatmeal) is just...plain...corny...   Award-winning musician Bono and actress Ashley Judd stopped in Iowa  City on Monday to plant a movement in some of the world's best soil.    Joined by an American AIDS expert, an HIV-infected African activist,  and a Ghanan musical group, the stars educated and attempted to inspire a  bubbling IMU crowd of more than 2,000 to fight the epidemic, which  kills 6,500 sub-Saharan Africans each day. Approximately 29 million  Africans are infected with the disease.    'I'm told you can grow anything here,' said Bono, who shed his  trademark leather jacket and wrap-around shades for the event. 'We're here to  grow a movement.'   Man...how long did it take him to draft that catchy little phrase???  (to read the whole delicious article, check the Pandyland e-mail box)         "
2844168,female,Marketing,"                 Good Community  Well  urlLink Kurt  has finally made his first post! It was getting quite funny because there was a whole discussion happening on his comments before he ever even posted. He had to come in and take control of his own blog. Quite amusing!!  I love Thursdays. I think I say that quite often. It's a busy refreshing day filled with great community experiences for me. This morning I headed to our Ladies Bible study, and I was anxious to see everyone because it had been about 3 weeks. Last week we had a break and the week before that Kurt & Michelle were here. It's just refreshing to be in the company of ladies who love God with all their heart, soul, and mind. I had a couple great discussions today and one of them was with a dear friend and she was affirming a lot of things that Ked and I have been struggling with lately. We had a little discussion on how we're (and by we're meaning a general statement about local churches) encouraging casual Christians. If you read  urlLink Ked's post on Community with a Po!nt , he was touching on the same topic and we've had several conversations with different people as of late. By not expecting anything of people, we're breeding a generation of casual Christians where it's easy to go to church, go to lifegroup and make it social, but not making and encouraging personal and spiritual growth and discipline. Another wise lady also discussed this morning how we've come to rely on the local church for things it was never meant to fulfill - such as depending on it solely for our spritual growth and maturity. Anyway, there's a lot of thoughts rumbling around there, but it's just nice to know we're not alone.  Then this evening we had another great Life Group session. We're going through the book of Romans and we're all thoroughly enjoying it. How can you not? When you open up the Word and God speaks so clearly through the written word and the Holy Spirit, how can you not get excited? Romans is so foundational to our faith, and it has been so great to get back to the basics of our need for salvation and the role faith plays. The exciting thing is we know we're just getting started - we're only on chapter 4. Then we sent the guys off to another room and in our smaller groups shared prayer requests and we took some good time sharing. I love that time when people open up to the struggles in their life and what God is teaching them, or admitting where they need to grow. It's so important to have a group of people like that who you know will pray for you and genuinely care. It was just an incredibly refreshing day.  And now I am exhausted and need to go bed! I actually fell asleep checking my e-mail before Life Group! That was quite funny. I haven't fallen asleep at my computer since my last job...oh did I just say that??               "
2948997,female,Student,"       So far, this week has been the most amazing experience of my life (or at least one of them) and I've met some people from all over Canada. This has been an awesome oppurninity to connect and establish friendships. There are a couple people here at Encounters that remind me of people from back home:  Jeremy: A major liberal supporter and plans on becoming PM one day, all he does is talk politics, and he debates with the facist which is very interesting to watch. This kid reminds me so much of our dear Alan, who would be proud at the liberal representation here in Ottawa...and by the way...there is a kid here who looks exactly like Alan. It seems that I've been followed...  The Facist: This kid is wack. Hello?! Did anyone hear that facisism...is  Dead? *Gasp* Anyways, this kid and the liberal are fun to watch combat each other.  The E-feminate boys: the ones who you question...the ones who make you just tilt your head and ponder...are they, or aren't they. It doesn't matter...I'll let them correct me.  Alright, so I had some serious fun adventures yesterday:  I went shopping in this marketplace, free of tax to support our artisans and now I come home with a new purse, a beenie hat, a buddha, a princess box, a couple of rings, and an assortment of other fun interesting stuff. I figure, I saved cash for nothing in particular so I've spent a good chunk.  I saw this belt yesterday with a chainsaw and I thought of Jamie...and his sick obbession with the TCM (TexChainMass). I didn't buy it...too damn expensive and we're going for sushi when I get home again...this time there will not be 104 spent.  Oh! So, I've travelled overseas twice in the last two days...I've been to Japan and to India. Thats right folks, it makes me proud to say that I've been to the High Commission and the Embassy. It bothers me that the Americans have an entire block dedicated to their HUGE embassy...which is full of CIA agents who read other peoples mail. Oh shit. They are probably reading this as we speak ******transmittion CUT*********** ******RESUME**************  It's 5:36 in the morning Ontario time..so thats 4:36 Manitoba time. It's early and I'm getting slighty sleepy. When I get back in to the city, it's time to shower and start studying along with call work and find out the damn schedule. Ah hah! An entire week off work...and come May long weekend, we're going to Westerns...another plane. Hells yes!  And By the way...Paul, I have dibbs near you...if I can get it.  I encourage any of you that are still under 18 to grasp this opporunity and seize with vigour. If your over 18, too bad *laughs* (no, sorry)... You can all see my pictures when I get them developed....  And...I'm still alone. There are people here who 'met the love of their lives' and become a couple. I know I'm not the only person who realizes this doesn't work because it seems that the couple is made of people from different ends of the country. PEI dates BC... does that work? NO  And...I'm making cabinet of the HoC...it's the goal.   Alright... I had a fabolous time...spend some time with me and I'll tell you some amazing stories.  I missed you all....  and I can swear in french...  always      "
1415200,female,Student,"       Things are known.  Everyone is catching on to me. I have people, left, and right asking me about it. I didnt know I was like a book. I dont think im so confused now. I kinda thought things thru a little bit last night, and today. Now it's just a race against time. I can't believe her. Being so selfish like that. I should have knew it would end up this way. She'll try and beat me to the punch, I know it. So, now, I am forced into making a decision I really dont want to make. About being inqusitive or not. (you get the point.) The thing is, I dont want this to turn out like another version of No Doubt. That would just suck. I know 'other people' dont want me to, for the sake of us all, but my feelings are telling me diffrent. But sometimes there blind. I dont want to just let this sit back and take it's coarse. I am afriad of the outcome.  I need to go and stratagise. Before it's too late, and the whole situation becomes 'The one that got away'    "

2821801,female,indUnk,"           Went out to  urlLink Chino Hills  with some of the  urlLink Team Basso  guys this morning.  Up at 6, small breakfast (my undoing), out the door by 7, riding by 8:30.  Rides with these guys typically go 12 miles or so - decent pace when you're actually riding, but some group members like to be more social than others - so you can rely on taking breaks every few miles or so.  What I'm tryin to say is the rides are never slug-fests.  After riding for a couple hours riding with the main pack (about 10 of us), we come to the fork in the road, easy home = left, more riding = right.  I'm feelin pretty good, crunching people on hills and I think I'm having a good day - so, right it is with 3 other guys.    At that point, its about 10:30 and heading into the hottest part of the day (hindsight = 20/20).  After dicking around being lost for about an hour or so, we find this 3.5 mile downhill run.  Sweet you say, save your energy... nope.  The rule in mountain biking goes, what you go down, you must go up.  Also, you gotta get your ass off the seat, which means all your weight is on your quads.  At the bottom of the hill we made the mistake of stopping - both my quads went out like Michael J. Fox in jenga.  I literally had to  punch  the back of my knee's to unlock the cramps.  Little did I know we probably had about 3,000 feet of elevation to climb.  LOL.  After borrowing a GU from a buddy, and stealing another's water, we set out on our way.  At this point, I've already stopped sweating (dehydrated), I'd had the chills for about an hour (dehydrated), was getting dizzy (dehydrated), and was about to  urlLink bonk  (not enough calories/sugar), all in 100 degree heat that isn't letting up (dehydrated).  My only thought, 'I'm fucked'.  Needless to say, I got home, and in the event you are writing this off as me being a drama queen, see below.       That's almost 4 beats per second folks.  Per  second .  If that  still  doesn't mean anything to you,  urlLink read this .     UPDATE :  The graph of my ride.  Can someone who preferably knows WTF they're doing help me with why my HR is all over the place?  urlLink Details here          "
3359005,male,Student,"             Ok... That title is entirely random and hysterical. But anyway, this is my comments on each individual team on the third leg of the race, with teams showing their flight arrangement skills for the first time. The first leg isn't counted cause the flight arrangements were printewd on their Route infos...  Colin & Christie -- A first place finish was entirely unearned. They were featured much more this time than in the previous episodes, and we all saw that there's really nothing much to them. They're only first because of their ability, if you can even consider it an ability, to outrun Charla. There will come a point in the race where the team will face some immense difficulty, and this team will crumble because of Chrisie's inability to keep calm and be nice. Colin is a great racer, with his ability to keep calm and his classy aggressiveness in getting his plane tickets. Christie, on the other hand, will do nothing except to bring the team down.  Charla & Mirna -- Charla & Mirna showed that they had mental powress that could overcome a lot of physical obstacles again. They are paying for it, with Charla having limited choices to make in the physical tasks. I love it that they're so aggressive but can still work well together, but they need to be nicer to the other teams. I know they're policy is to be nice to those who are nice to them, but they do not need to flare up at those who aren't. If they didn't flare up today I think they'll be in a good position to go very far, but at this point, a Yeild might be the price to pay for being mean. Boo Mirna! Charla is having a hell lot of fun in the race, except the part where she turned into a chocolate loving frankenstein after getting electrocuted. It's sad that they made an alliance with people they cannot trust... They really need to use their Yeild power now, with most effect on Marshall & Lance.  Brandon & Nicole -- Nicole first; it wasn't a smart move revealing your bond with Charla & Mirna at the airport. I fully agree with Mirna on this one. One good thing is that she has revealed herself to not be the whiny one in this race, cause Christie is the one that has gone miles ahead of her in this area. Brandon seems to be the only one in this team, taking the reins in trying to find flights, doing the tasks cause he's stronger, and according to him has a bigger stomach for chocolate. I have to give the team their props on getting to the 2nd flight, cause I really didn't see them working. Maybe it was just dumb luck. It was really despicable of this team to go leave Charla & Mirna in the lurch like that, with possibly no flight out.   Bob & Joyce -- I'm actually starting to like this team, of course under a certain influence. They've been consistent in their 4th - 5th place finishes even with their lack of physicality. They weren't featured much in this episode, but I think they can use their age more to their advantage while getting flights. Too mild to fight off the aggressive teams at the moment, but sneak under the covers and be really, really nice, and you'll get pecedence over the others when it comes to this area. Maybe the world of internet dating isn't so bad after all...  Kami & Karli -- They got really lucky with the flights this week, but it might just die on them next week. Their characters are so similar that it is impossible to tell between the 2. Didn't notice much of them this leg, except for the fact that they keep bumping into Chip & Kim everywhere. Really showed their stupidity by missing the strip of shallow water leading to the island. Coupled with them walking right past the cluebox last week, I will safely quote my friend saying, 'They use their legs more than their eyes.' Big Question: Will they be back battling for last place with Chip & Kim? Definitely yes, and they'll hopefully be joined by Marshall & Lance.  Linda & Karen -- Karen's definitely the better racer in this team. She's giving way to Linda the big chicken by letting her do the easier, more enjoyable tasks. Linda will definitely bring the team down at some point, and Karen won't be able to do anything to stop it. Unless Karen has the angel-like temperament of Zach last season, she will also not be able to take the heat and will collapse with exhaustion at having to give way to her much weaker teammate.  Chip & Kim -- Back in third to last place, and Chip declares that they're moving up, slowly but surely. Surely you realise the elimination cut off point is moving up faster than you are. Chip didn't really show any of his idiotic qualities this week, but I'm sure it'll come out next week. Hopefully we get to see whichever one, the twins or them, get to the Yeild and try and kill one another. Chip is such and idiot but doesn't use his meaness meaningfully, like in getting his tickets.  Marshall & Lance -- Marshall & Lance was the team that really deserved to go this week. I said already that I wouldn't mind, and wouldn't be surprised if these 2 went. I'm going to say that again this week... I give them their props for getting the second flight out, but that 'I'm dead' attitude at the roadblock probably would've made 10 white chocolates go down his throat without them noticing. The guy that wasn't doing to roadblock wasn't helping. Showing your frustration at you teammate is never a good idea. They are really boring, and ti sure looks like they get into trouble next week.  Jim & Marsha -- This pair definitely could've made it together. They're like the nice guy team this time aroung beside Bob & Joyce, and we would've loved to see them go further. As much as I don't want to, I have to bash them for their lack of skill in getting plane tickets. Really horrid that you managed to get tickets for someone else on the flight you weren't booked on. And in the whole race I've never, ever heard of only one team member being booked on a flight... Sad. They stayd positive till the end and there's a plus point for them.         "
766556,female,indUnk,"        Mars Mania  Have you had a chance to see Mars yet?  It's so close to the earth right now that its just screaming 'Look at Me!' up there in the night sky.  Other than the moon and one or two constellations, it's just about the only celestial object I can identify.  And now its even easier to find.    I took a few moments to contemplate the red planet last night from my balcony, and i started to get a little nervous about what it's close proximity may portend.

2844168,female,Marketing,"                  I love it when a plan comes together!   Don't you love it when God answers a prayer right away? That doesn't always happen, because our timing isn't always His timing. But now and then our timings match up and when we whisper a 'please, God' Boom! We see the answer not much later. I love that about God. He's so big and awesome.  Ked's sister Karon has been looking forward to coming to visit with us in the sunshine for awhile. Plans here and there kept falling through and then a seemingly perfect plan for her to catch a ride with a cousin was all in place. It was going to work out great! Ked and I were a little bummed though because this particular plan meant we wouldn't get to see her as much as we would have liked, but nonetheless we knew how desperately she needed a vacation and we were excited to see her no matter how short it would be. She called us this morning and said now that plan had fallen through too and the cousin wasn't going to be able to come. We were all disappointed. She had already taken the time off work, and she needed to get away. Frankly, we needed the company too. All day long we all thought about it. We chatted again earlier this evening and she was checking for plane tickets online, but everything was so expensive and to get a good price she'd have to drive a few hours. I pulled out my laptop and whispered a 'please, God, you know how much she needs a vacation. Can you please help us to find an amazing price on a ticket?' I searched a few of my usual spots and nothing too great came up unless she was willing to drive over 2 hours to an airport.  So I called her again later and told her what I did find. In the meantime she was about ready to throw her computer out the window. She had found a good price and was willing to drive the couple hours. Just as she was going to book the ticket she got booted off the internet and had to restart. As she was rebooting I kept checking. I said 'hey, have you checked the Grand Rapids airport?' (only 45 minutes away). She replied that she hadn't even checked them because they are usually so much more expensive. Figuring we had nothing to lose I checked the flights from GR. 'Karon, you are NOT going to believe what I just found!!' I found tickets out of Grand Rapids for way less than anything else we had found today. When I told her the dates and the price she squealed, 'BOOK IT!! Here's the credit card number!!' That is just like God. She now has a better vacation planned than any of her previous options. The price was right, out of the most convenient airport, and she gets to spend more time here than any of her other options provided, thanks to the good flight schedules.  Thank you, God for listening to our heart's desires and knowing what we need. And thank You for Hotwire.com!!  Can't wait to see you Tuesday, sis!!!!               "

3869393,female,Technology,"       For many years thro' my childhood, I always wondered, what makes a person,'a special' person.&nbsp;   Thro' my schooling years, I had been travelling a lot, so never got to really check out my school mates well enough&nbsp;or make friends who has lasted beyond those years in that particular school.&nbsp; I had seen all my friends running around with their boyfriends, passing comments on the guys as they stood over 100m away, etc, but never could figure out what really makes a person attain a new height of a 'special' friend.  After very many years of pondering, keenly watching women and men go crazy over each other, I think I have come to a point where I can atleast contribute to this topic now..  So here are the 10 reasons I beleive justify elevating a person to a 'special' person category:  1. Trust : This is not something which drops out of the heavens, and is a value which needs to be truely earned at each and every level.  2. Selflessness : Putting 'you' infront of 'i', this makes a world of difference!  3.&nbsp; Dependability: When the entire world has shut it's doors on your face, you there's one person whom you can always turn you.  4.&nbsp; Advicer : This probably be the one and only person whom one will be able to digest any comment, whether nasty, sarcastic or developmental. This person is always a constructive critic!  5.&nbsp; Emotional Support : Irrespective of the nature of the problem, however personal it is, this is the one person with whom you should feel that you at letting down your burden from your heart.  6.&nbsp; Meaning of Time : Time will not stand in the way of anything.&nbsp; Whatever the time, time period, this is the one person whom you can count on to be there around you.  7.&nbsp; Respect : Irrespective of whether the entire world shuns you, this person still holds you with all the respect, mainly because they trust you to no end at all!  8.&nbsp; Determination: The power being able to focus ones' engry to hold things in a particular manner, and the ability to strive from there on towards the goal post with you, is what defines determination!  9.&nbsp; Smile : As trivial as it sounds, a smile is something which is necessary to keep any relationship happy!&nbsp; The power of positive vibes is more than enough to scare away all those fears and stupidity from your heart!  10.Commitment : The ability to stand against all odd and support you in the worst of adversities, provides just that rounded touch to any relationship!

4192173,male,Technology,"             I'm saddened to read reports that 16 Volt have called it a day. Once upon a time, it seemed as though Eric and co. we're going to be the break out stars of that scene we were all once a part of. The Kidd, Mark Mohtashemi and I were big fans of this band, especially during their Skin/LetDownCrush era, which I think many feel was their peak. Those two records are classics and really had a unique sound and feel to it. During this period, Eric did an awesome remix for us of CROSS, which is on our second CD. Later, they assembled what I felt was going to be the 'dream team' with Krayge Tyler, Mike Peoples, and Servo, and while it kicked ass live, I felt Supercoolnothing was a bit of a let down (no pun intended. While I loved the songs, I felt it was too metal for my taste, though i find myself going back to it every now and then.  I don't know the circumstances of thier break up, but I know they had recorded new material via a demo deal with Capitol or some major, which I can only assume fell through. Also, Jason was telling me how he had been talking to Eric about an Acumen/16v double bill. I guess that's off, but it could have made for a hell of a swan song. Now I double regret our showing up too late to see them in LA last month.  I think 16V had a few more good albums in them. Perhaps later down the line they can bring it back. In the meantime, I hope this doesn't stop Eric Powell from continuing to make music. He's an extremely talented dude.  In the meantime, about a year or so ago, the aggression began demo'ing songs for what might have been their next CD. the material was quite good, but debate ensued as to weather or not these were aggression songs and they are currently in 'limbo'. A song or two from the 'Fernwood Terrace' sessions will probably end up on the Ass Cobra album, but one of those songs, titled 1956 will now be appearing on the Hypefactor record. I'm REALLY excited about this track, which is very Primal Scream, and appreciate Ash signing off on it. We'll work on it tomorrow night.  F         "

4192173,male,Technology,"             A whirlwind of a day ended at 3am last night and after a long day of the au bon pain, studio, chinese food, fixing my fonts, more studio, Pluck U, Saintface, many drinks, soical time with the ladies of Internationalpoontang.com, a near barfight, a guy in a thong (yes he was the near barfight), a very public threesome (yes this involved the guy in the thong), and some pizza, I feel we all earned the right to sleep in this morning...  We were able to find Leo somewhere in NYC yesterday and after a fun breakfast catching up, we dragged his ass into the Birdcage and put him to work. As predicted and hoped for, Leo again left his mark on EXIT STRATEGIES. Let me be frank with you, I was handling problems in my other professional life, but Leo, at B's direction (Earn that producing credit, son!) did some sweet ass backing vocals for THE MORNING AFTER THE LIFE BEFORE. I had many ideas for backing vocals for this, but they went way out of my range (and believe me I tried), but Leo really came up with some great stuff that I think really punctuates the choruses significantly. While doing all this, Leo somehow fixed a recent font related problem in my computer, for which I am very very greatful, while giving me thousands of new fonts to play with!   We then gave Leo a playback of the song we wrote with him and Jamie Duffy, OUR FAITH, because he hadn't heard our changes. There weren't many other than my new vocals, so he he was really into it. He will be playing his own version of the song with his band, AM PACIFIC, at their upcoming shows in LA. You can't get a better compliment than that! After some Great Wall, we put a guitar in his hand. Brandt had wanted him to tackle LENINGRAD, but honestly I feel that song is truly developed, so, as mentioned in a previous entry, I knew we could do more to 1956, so we got him on the verses and boy did this turn out to be one of my better decisions. I won't give much away, but it's still getting further away from Primal Scream and closer and closer to Hypefactor. The effort is worth it, and like Charles before him, Leo now has opened new doors to this song that I think are going to make for an amazing final song. We're almost there with that track.  Thanks to Leo, always the pro, for coming in and really pushing our material forward again...  Later, I met back home with Irene for some Pluck U (which means she worked late and is too tired to fight me on the topic of dinner) and then had a few drinks with the ladies of Internationalpoontang.com, some of whom are quite sunburnt from extended sunbathing on either Long Island or Asia, depending on which poontanger you are speaking to. Congrats to Poontanger D on her new digs and the excellent drinks and kudos to whoever made the jello shots that Dan Hamill and Irene consumed like it was nobody's business.  From there we were off to see the Face, back in action. I think I missed a gig due to an LA visit, so I was psyched. I think I have mentioned my hatred of the venue, Sine-E, before, mostly because of their horrible technical problems. This time, the face were problem-free and the gig was another enjoyable experience. If anything, my dear comrade Mr. Peter is far too prolific for his own good. I feel like we're on album 5 when I don't even own album 1. Right when I get attached to a song, he goes and writes three more. My concern is that songs I loved a year or two ago will never see the light of day in my ipod. I know the album will own and don't get me wrong, the guy doesn't write a bad song. It's just we're 5 albums in when I still want albums 1-4. I love the man, I love his band, (and yes you SAW me singing along to the last song, Joe) and I say all this purely out of love for the music that I want to own. As a musician, I understand not wanting to be stuck playing the same songs over and over again, but songs like I LOVE YOU, MADLY and THERE IS A ROOM (which I'm certain has to be on the album) got you to the dance and got a lot of people in that venue last night. Give them the hits, lads, give them the hits!  We spent some time with the lads after the show. Peter, B and I discussed the HF album, and while he has his head around EXIST, melodically, CLEAN UP is a problem, so we are going to get Peterface into the Birdcage in July to work on it as a gang. I have now given him a deadline and he promises to stick to it. He's the last person we need to finish recording this album (No pressure, guy!).  Then at some randumb (intentional spelling) lower east side bar that seemed straight out of 1981, Dan Hamill didn't like the way a drunk man (with his thong exposed and shirt lifted) was treating one of our friends and he made this known. Dan Hamill is not an easy man to provoke so when I accidentally walked into this I just stood quietly backing him up while he defended the honour of our friend. I'm still not sure what this was all about, quite frankly. In fact, I am going to try to ask him to write something for the blog explaining, but he made quite an impact on this crew. After, one of the guys, obviously intimidated by my beard while backing up Dan Hamill, tried to sweet talk me, and I responded with 'As long as none of my friends are fucked with, you'll be ok'. After that, they went to the back of the bar so the guy in the thong could resume his dry humping of the two girls who were making out (yes we have photos). We have travelled all over the world with very few problems, or three ways so this is one for the books just to see Dan Hamill as Harrison Ford. I already respected that kid, but after last night, I respect him more.  The lovely day ended with a slize of pizza and garlic knots for my girl and I. As Leo and I sing in a song: Mas Bien.  +F         "

Hot rocks. In regards to your questions:  1. You can feel the heat right through the java jacket. It's warmer. Try it.  2. I've never ordered an extra-hot latte and been disappointed. They're always plenty hot.  3. In the depths of winter, I prefer extra hot bevys. In summer, I go for standard temps.  4. & 5. When it comes to bevys, I don't concern myself with actual temperature numbers. That's more for weather and fevers than for coffee.  I predict that Hal will crumble and order an extra-hot latte sometime this winter, just to see what the hype is about.   Then she will be one of us.         "

3644456,male,indUnk,"       So Nomar is gone as we all know, and I say, good for him, and good for the Red Sox.   He wasn't going to stay, and he was acting like a bitch the last few weeks because he wasn't getting any attention, and he wanted to be healthy for free agency.   'I called him in his hotel room just to wish him luck and thank him for all he did for the franchise,' Sox CEO Larry Lucchino said last night. 'Then I asked him, 'How's the heel?' He said, 'It's great.'' '(I said,) 'Great? How can it be great? Two days ago, you thought you were going to have to go on the DL.' He said, 'Yeah, well, it's great now.''  Sox sources even alleged that Garciaparra said that he wanted to make sure he was healthy at the end of the season, when he would have to take a  November physical  as part of the free agent process.    The Sox (and new ownership) weren't going to resign him, and were offended when he rejected a 4yr/15m dollar contract last year.  So, pressured to make a deal, Theo though we might as well get some players out of this before he leaves for free (Cabrera isn't a bad player, and that play last night wasn't his fault - that's Terry's for not telling him the correct relay position.  It's ALSO terry's fault that Pedro wasn;t in the game in the 8th inning.)  Nomar was being a cancer in the clubhouse, despite the fact the guy DOES play as hard as he can while in there (and produces with stats).  But the other players were tired with the, 'woe is me' bullshit, and Nomar was tired of the daily soap opera that is Boston Red Sox Nation.  The problem with Nomar, as we are now finding out, is intangibles.  You never know what to get with Nomar (see: sitting out 13 inning games versus Yankees this year), even though statistically (and even physical talent wise) he has the greater past.  Remember when Sox and Yankee fans used to debate whether Jeter or Nomar was better?  Well, the debate is similar to 'Who's career will be better? Michael Jackson and Prince?'    Michael Jackson, early in his career, was a young and hot talent.  A young prospect with great dancing talent from the Jackson 5, he came out solo and was winning awards.  He carried on his family's tradition.  He was the face of pop music, making millions..............  All in while Prince just kept the consistency turning out hit after hit, being original and gaining a fan base, making a movie, and maybe not outselling Jackson, but doing enough to be a force. He was making money and being a big player in music.   Then, MJ fell off the face of the earth when he became a white pedo pop queen; while Prince became a Jehovah's witness and STILL continues to make good, solid albums that quietly get the job done on the charts.  He OUTLASTED him.  As Chris Rock said, 'In the end.....dat nigga Prince won!'  Quietly, with a little flair, and consistency.......that's Derek Jeter.  Just like Prince, you know he's going to come around again and again and never disappoint, especially in the clutch.  He was never GREAT in terms of stats (or album sales or in dancing talent when comparing Prince to MJ) but you know what you're getting with him: a true leader and gamer who'll play every game with blood and sweat all while batting .310 with 15-20 HR and 80-90 RBI,  and a .400+ OBP with over 100 runs scored; and of course......banging hotter chicks (which is true in BOTH cases).  Nomar?  Once a much better player in the field and on the plate, his numbers have decreased over the years.  He can't play everyday (Orlando Cabrera, can) .  His defense isn't what it used to be.  His heel, ankle, and wrist are a concern.  A 2 time batting champ and once hitting .325 with 30/100+, now he's about as good as Jose Valentin with a little better batting average.  Oh, and his OBP STINKS (partly due to his philosophy at the plate, but every time Nomar popped up I wanted to kick MYSELF in the nuts).  I think that's why we had to give the Cubs an extra prospect.....because THEY knew what the risks where in getting this guy.  He's a head case (just look at him in the plate).  He was the most paranoid player in Boston sports history; the media gave him good press, and the fans (esp. kids) loved him, and he still thought everyone was out to get him as if he was Alex Jones at a Republican dinner.  Like Drew Bledsoe, it was time to go.  Time will tell if Nomar will take a page ad in both the Herald and Globe to at the least, thank the fans of Boston who loved him and remembered the GREAT times (1997-2000), even when frustrated (this one included).  He needed a change, and so did we.  We gave up a great shortstop, but we got depth, defense, and some intangibles back (Doug Mient....whatever his name is a good friend of David Ortiz, and is a leader.)  Only time will tell in wins and losses (and where Nomar goes next) whether how things will play out.       "

589736,male,Technology,"           Q. In a recent Answer Man, you stated Johnny Depp based his character in 'Pirates of the Caribbean' on Keith Richards. While this is true, he also based his character on one more influence: Pepe Le Pew, the skunk from Looney Tunes. Depp says...   'Yeah, I kind of incorporated the idea of Keith. Not like an imitation of Keith or anything but just that wisdom that he carries, that sort of confidence that he has, that attack that he has. So I got that on one side and on the other side I took a little bit of this cartoon character that I've always loved when I was a kid, his name was Pepe Le Pew. Yeah, the skunk. He smelled horrible, but was absolutely convinced that he was the ultimate ladies' man. You know the guy, he'd fall in love with this cat and the cat quite clearly despised him but Pepe Le Pew sort of read it as, 'Oh, she's just playing hard to get. Oh, she's just shy.' '  Sean Leslie,  Salt Lake City, Utah   A. Now that it's been pointed out, I can see the resemblance. And to think I said he was merely channeling a drunken drag queen.

Am NOT a morning person, and I hate having 9 am classes. eep....skipped a couple already. And I have another tomorrow!  The  job so far is pretty cool.  Getting to know the people at work a lil' better, and Jah-mes seems to be loosening up. He's actually a pretty nice guy. :-)   I guess one of the perks of the job are the free coffee and food. I mean the last place I worked at was so anal about making money it charged its employees if they wanted to eat the food there! While they were working! I mean I can understand if any day you just happened to pop by and ordered something, you'd have to pay, but I mean come on, if you've been working there 4 hours in a row and there's no lunch break and if you wanna grab something to munch on while there weren't customers, you still have to pay?? So much for employee benefits.   Phew   I hoped all that made sense.  Whatever it is, I like how the job's going so far. Have decided to take one of the church aunties' advice and put aside a lil' each week (after tithing of course) as part of a savings plan. There's this fund/investment management firm where I can transfer $$ from my bank account, earn interest through them, and transfer the $$ back anytime I want. It's pretty good, and the current rate is 4.75% on yr principal, calculated   daily  , with no other charges, and no minimal principal amount. Sounds pretty good eh? Hopefully can save enough to go for a lil' holiday back home to S'pore at the end of the year. :-)  Okies, enough for now. Here are some things I MUST do, and soon...  1. Stop munching on those addictive Arnott's Mint Slices  2. Reduce chockie intake - just now the house (that's Evelyn, Me, EG, Shawn, Chris, and Jon who wasn't around 'coz he was out) took a stock take and realised that ALL my snacks had choc. content, even the healthy muesli bars...sigh  3. Start exercising - which may be hard 'coz I can't make the Taibox classes this sem, and my ankle's acting up. Btw, haven't even started using my new running gear!! eek...   Oh yes, on this note, just caught a really freaky episode of Smallville, this Clark Kent-in-highschool drama. A pretty-but-plump (aren't we all?) girl was desperate to lose weight so she started drinking veggie shakes made out of veggies found in her garden. Thing is, some meteors from Krypton had landed there when Clark aka Superman landed on Earth, and so the veggies were genetically altered somehow. Everytime she drank them, her fat content reduced dramatically (liposuction w/o the tubes), so she became slim pretty fast! Woohoo...BUT after awhile she started getting really hungry, and the only way she could successfully stave off the hunger was by consuming another being's fat - like a deer, and this mean guy that used to bully her. Hows   that   for revenge??!! Creeeppy...'come one come all, meet the the Incredible Shrinking Girl Who Sucks Up Your Fat!!' eeeek.....   4.

649790,female,indUnk,"               Today...   I miss my sister terribly - it just seems strange not to have her hanging around, irritating me (just joking...). Even though it was only for a week, she really made her presence felt, and I mean that in a good way. Just doing the scrapbook for our trtip to Tasmania brings fond memories of a time past recently - last week in fact.  Maybe it's just the thought that I won't see her for quite a while - with her going to Bristol in Sept/Oct and all. She represented, on a deeper level, a link to my family back home. Oh how I miss them all.  Tomorrow is the start of a new term. How did the holidays fly by so quickly? I can honestly say it has been an eventful break, what with all the travelling I've done, and the things I've seen. Still no luck with the job hunt though. Favour Lord, Favour!!  There's still so much to do and see. This semester promises to be a challenging one, with me taking two Film subjects (equating to two 3000 word essays in the middle of the semester! ), hopefully holding fort with a job, and I haven't gotten round to taking those driving lessons I've been saving up for (and which money I have technically spent already on ordinary expenses...). I'm also planning to help out with the Children's Ministry in church, and am also taking an Alpha course, which is sorta a foundation studies thing  - good 'coz it's like going back to the basics of the Bible. Wow - so many things to accomplish - grace needed here!  Well, Shawn's back, which means I see even less of EG 'coz his comp. and best bud are both at Jon's place (Shawn's Jon's new roomie). Woopadeedoo... Everyone always kids that the 2 of 'em are like lovers! (erm, EG and Shawn, not EG and his comp., although now that I think about it, the PC always seems to hum a little when EG's around...) Anyways, the point is, in this little love triangle, I'm the 'concubine' you see. Unless you go by EG's version, which is that I'm the 'wife', the one he's married to, while Shawn's the 'mistress', the one who he really wants to be with. Haha...whatever...  No lah, it's good that he hangs out with his buddy - gives me a lil' space, a lil' of my time you know? So however much I whine that I'll never see as much of EG now that Shawn's back, I'm pretty ok about it, plus I'm glad Shawnie's back too. Miss his sudden rants about society's faults and the various places in Melbourne which are 'a bloody rip-off!!'  Welcome back Shawn.          "

MJ wanted to tell Large Institutional Client A that if we prioritized work ask they have asked us to do, then we would have to revise the timeline for Large Institutional Client B (Large Institutional Client A and Large Institutional Client B are competitors - which means that LICA could give a phlying phuck what happens to LICB's timelines and would think we were morons for even presenting it as a discussion point).

3601456,female,indUnk,"                 So, one of my good friends has left the lovely environs of LA.  That leaves me with about 2 close friends left in LA.  Down from 20 or so friends that I had from my grad school program and from back in the day.  This is a very sad state of events!!!  One of my two friends says that LA is very transient and that people come and go often here.  I agree...So I will probably be leaving town as well.  We shall see...  But why do I only have two friends left in LA you may ask!!?!?!  Both of which I knew before I got here???  I am not THAT weird, I know how to make friends...I promise...but I have decided that west coast people and east coast/southern people are very different.  To the point that I can actually lump east coast and southern people together because these usually different groups are one and the same when comparing to the west coast.  They ask the same questions...Why do these west coast people stay on the west coast and never leave?  Why are everyone's boobs also used for flotation devices?  Why are Uggs at all stylish when the weather doesn't drop below 70?  Why is the weather so eerily nice but the people aren't?  Why do people surf in the cold ass Pacific to almost get eaten by sharks?  okay, enough with the questions.  But seriously, I cannot seem to get on the same wavelength as the folks here- even at the most fun world of where I work.  Lest you think I am crazy, many of my friends who have left town and the ones (2) that are still here feel the same way.  It is an odd odd land of the west.  So, I figure I will go to NYC where they may be odd as well, but at least they are the east coast kind of odd.  That I can deal with.               "

883178,male,Fashion,"            PB's Thursday 3    If you could be in any branch of the military, which would you choose and why?  When I was 17 and a senior in high school, I went through about a month-long phase where I wanted to join the Marines.  I went on and on about this...I remember vividly.  I was enamored with the uniforms, the challenge, the extreme toughness, the yelling, the fact that most Marines are sick-in-the-head.  When my brother caught wind of my plans, he laughed his ass off, especially because at the time I was about 90 pounds and nowhere close to as tough as I am now.  (I'll kick your ass if you disagree.)  He then challenged me to do 50 push-ups in a row.  I could not do it.  So I changed my mind.    But, to answer the question, I still dream about being a Marine, so that's the branch I would choose now.   What are your comfort foods/guilty pleasures?  I'm with Duf on the donut thing: I love getting 2 Boston Cremes from Dunkin' Donuts (Double Down with the Double D, Hal.).  Especially because I love hearing the Indian guy with his THICK Indian accent say 'Yes maam, 2 Boston Cremes.' And I like classic, just out of the fryer Krispy Kremes.  I also adore Mac & Cheese.  My guilty pleasure is to read the latest copy of US magazine on my plane rides to and from NYC.  Sometimes I hide it in a copy of Business 2.0 or Smithsonian (sounds like pervy Saddam) just because I am always on business flights and am afraid my fellow passengers will think I'm an airhead.  I can't get enough of the celebrity gossip.  I need serious help.   The thong movement has passed along an overall benefit to American fashion and the appearance of the American fanny. Discuss.

Then there are pajama pants and wool socks to be shed, and the flannel shirt under the sweatshirt, and the t-shirt under that, and the underwear, and this whole time I have the shower going already to try and steam up the bathroom a bit.

Maybe this is typical to movies in general (going in phases, all of the movies are from the last year) or maybe it's just how (again) in Korea things are very much fads; where once a theme gets started it's difficult to stop it.    urlLink     Public Enemy, WildCard, The Big Swindle and Old Boy    With that in mind, I think of my night out on Saturday. A group of friends and I had dinner and a movie in the 동대문 ( urlLink Dongdaemoon ) area then headed to 대학로 (pronounced Daehan-ro, but the Korean spelling is Dae-Hak-Ro: Daehak means university, ro is street, so (as you may have guessed) it is a street near universities--so, of course, there are tons of bars there). It was raining as a typhoon is in town (see the  urlLink typhoon tracker page  for updates of when one is on its way here) so there weren't many people out on the town. (I, however, didn't mind it as the rain here is pretty warm and I was in shorts a shirt and cut-away sneakers...really quite comfortable.) We went to about 5 places before finding one called 꾼 (Kkoon, an intersting name). The gal running the place said it was their first business day, but the place was empty. The music, however, was really good so I said, 'Service.', as in: what will you give us to come in? She offered plates of snacks and such...sold! The prices were lower than I'm used to, too...a good place.   So, how does this connect? The ambiance. The bar was like many other ones out there with tables, low lighting, club music, and a table or two that has a trough in the middle for ice and imported beer and coolers (we had 8 different kinds). I guess this is a safe business strategy as it may be fatal to go out on a limb with a new concept in this town unless it does very well, in which case you'll have lots of imitators.   I wonder what the next trend will be? Whatever it is, it'll catch on fast.  urlLink (JoongAng Ilbo article on this topic.)           "

Everyday I... • wake up • exercise • go to work • come home • Q.T. with Carlene • sleep  And it just repeats. I know once something becomes routine sooner or later it becomes boring and I fear that is what I am becoming. Partially because, and I think this could be one of the many reasons... I don't have a lot of my own set of friends here, sad but true and it's partially my own fault.  It'll be a year next month since I moved from Canada to sunny California and I must admit it's hard to make friends outside of Carlene's group of friends. I figure it was easier back in the day because I was still in school and it was just easier to meet people on a daily basis who were in your age group and had similar interests. Now that I'm done school and working the making friends thing is a little harder.  I can't use the whole...' I just moved here from Canada' bit because 1 yr is more than enough time to adjust. I need to get out more, join groups or something and I'm gonna start doing just that this weekend. Well tonight I'm heading back to Carlene's place in Chino and we might hit up a grad party, then tommorow nite is her friend's b-day so we'll do that but on Sunday I'm free to go back to Costa Mesa and figure out what there is to do. What groups are there to join around my apartment. I wanna stay away from the Club and Bar scene, I am so over that part of my life....but what else is there to do?

History is a construct... Any point of entry is possible and all choices are arbitrary.   Still, there are definative moments we use as references, because they break our sense of continuity, they change the direction of time.  We can look at these events and we can say that after them things were never the same again.  They provide beginnings for us, and endings too.  Births and deaths, for instance, and marriages.'

An altruistic, nihilistic, pot smoking, tree hugging hippy. Imagine 'Office Space'....  *shrugs*   I dont know what he's trying to prove. If anything. I think he thinks he's smarter than the rest of the board - so he posts cryptic messages that only other pot smoking hippies can understand. In board terms he's relegated to 'shit-stirrer' status, b/c, for all intents and purposes, he has nothing else to say, but he's angry damnit.    For reference, other members of the 'angry left' have things like this to say:  Quote: I Hope the Bloodshed Continues in Iraq Well, that should bring the bats out of the attic with fangs dripping. I won't be hypocritcal. It is politically correct, particularly in any Dem discussion to hope and pray and feel for our troops and scream 'bring them back now'. I'm fighting something bigger. I'm a 58 year old broad and I can tell you that what is going on in our country isn't the usual ebb and flow of politics where one party is in power and then another; where the economy goes through ups and downs.......yawn, yawn--just wait a bit and things will turn out peachy keen. That stupid la-la land is over. I realize that not every GI Joe was 100peeercent behind Prseeedent Booosh going into this war; but I do know that that is what an overwhelming number of them and their famlies screamed in the face of protesters who were trying to protect these kids. Well, there is more than one way to be 'dead' for your country. They are not only not accompishing squat in Iraq, they are doing crap nothing for the safety, defense of the US of A over there directly. But 'indirectly' they are doing a lot. The only way to get rid of this slime bag WASP-Mafia, oil barron ridden cartel of a government, this assault on Americans and anything one could laughingly call 'a democracy', relies heavily on what a shit hole Iraq turns into.  They need to die so that we can be free. Soldiers usually did that directly--i.e., fight those invading and harming a country. This time they need to die in defense of a lie from a lying adminstration to show these ignorant, dumb Americans that Bush is incompetent. They need to die so that Americans get rid of this deadly scum. It is obscene, Barbie Bush, how other sons (of much nobler blood) have to die to save us from your Rosemary's Baby spawn and his ungodly cohorts.   AND, they get really REALLY pissed off when they read sites like:   urlLink Healing Iraq   Written by an Iraqi in support of the US 'occupation'.

Oh, and one last link from the urlLink  LA Times  - from a reformed lefty who had this to say:   Quote: We put them in those rowboats — we antiwar demonstrators, we sophisticated, smart guys. The war was nearly over when I graduated from high school. But high school students were old enough to demonstrate. They were old enough to feel superior to the fools who were running the government. And they were old enough to have known better. They were old enough to have understood what communist regimes had cost the world in suffering, from the prisons of Havana to the death camps of Siberia. Today we are haunted, in thinking about Iraq, by the fact that a noisy, self-important, narcissistic minority talked the United States into betraying its allies. (Loyalty didn't mean a lot to antiwar demonstrators; honor didn't mean a lot.) We betrayed our allies and hurried home, to introspect. They stayed on, to suffer. We were eager to make love, not war, but the South Vietnamese weren't offered that option. Their alternatives were to knuckle under or die. It was my fault, mine personally; I was part of the antiwar crowd and I'm sorry. But my apology is too late for the South Vietnamese dead. All I can do is join the chorus in shouting, 'No more Vietnams!' No more shrugging off tyranny; no more deserting our friends; no more going back on our duties as the strongest nation on Earth.   *************************************** I'll be the one to protect you from  Your enemies and all your demons  I'll be the one to protect you from  A will to survive and a voice of reason  I'll be the one to protect you from  Your enemies and your choices son  One and the same I must isolate you  Isolate and save you from yourself. ***************************************         "

Los Angeles isn’t anything I thought it would be.  It wasn’t as flashy as I had imagined.  It didn’t seemed as pretentious as it looks on TV and there was no preparing me for the weather.  LA was amazing and good to me.    I tend to fall in love with most cities that I visit.  Maybe it’s because travel is a carefree existence or maybe it’s because each city beckons to a different part of me.  Why did I fall in love with LA?  Well, it isn’t the rat race it seems to be or maybe I never came in contact with part of it.  And the sun shines everyday.  There are never clouds in the sky or rainy, mucky days (there are also not stars).  I knew this about LA, but I didn’t believe it.  My clouded East Coast brain couldn’t fathom endless days of pure sunshine.  How could you be sad in a place like this because whatever happens, at least it’s a beautiful day.    My love for LA is fleeting, though.  I know when I am home I’ll settle back into the humidity and heat and then the cool air of fall and the snow of winter.  I would miss the seasons if I lived here.  Endless days of sitting by the pool would begin to disorient me.  Life here would be like an endless vacation.  It would be like play, like pretend, just beyond the touch of reality.  And my love for LA is not true because it is shared with my love for London, New York, San Francisco, Seattle, and Morehead City.  LA is just another city to add to the list of places I could live if I ever decided to pack up and leave the state and family I know so well.  I never do make plans to move to the cities I love so much because I think if I lived there the magic would begin to disappear after a time and I don’t want that to happen.  I’d rather hold these cities in my heart as perfect gems nestled on hillsides or islands or by the sea, covered in fog or basking in sunlight.         "

It's a good idea to get information from all sources - CNN, Fox News, NY Times, or one marine - and my point was that too many people take a biased look at something without seeing both sides.  For instance,  urlLink this  is something interesting I've read recently.  Another media source that should not to be taken as the end-all-be-all, but to be read with a grain of salt.  Politics, violence in society, and foreign policy is not my forte, and I'm not going to pretend I know everything about such matters.  So I won't.         "
3869393,female,Technology,"       This is something I had on my Website..and has made a huge impact in quite a few of my friends lives..coz they used this to decide whether or not they were in love...  Does your heart ache and break when they're sad? Then it's love.  Do you cry for their pain, even when they're strong? Then it's love.  Do their eyes see your true heart, and touch your soul so deeply it hurts? Then it's love.  Do you stay because a blinding, incomprehensible mix of pain and relation pulls you close and holds you there? Then it's love.  Do you accept their faults because they're a part of who they are? Then it's love.  Are you attracted to others, but stay with them faithfully without regret?Then it's love.   Would you allow them to leave you, not because they want to but because they have to? Then its love.  Would you give them your heart, your life, your death? Then it's love.  Now, if love is painful, and tortures us so, why do we love? Why is it all we search for in life? This pain, this agony? Why is it all we long for? This torture, this powerful death of self? Why? The answer is so simple cause it's...LOVE. It is such an addiction that even people who are not having it wish to experience and share it with .            "

Guess (at least over the past few days) it hasn't been as daily as the title says...  2 exams down, none to go :) -- All I have to do from today (actually yesterday) until tomorrow is just show up at school for any periods that I have a class. No exams, but we have to be there for attendance purposes. Today I have my Computer Science AP class; I think we're watching  Harry Potter and CoS  for the two hour exam period. At least I'm taking my Xbox and that DVD up to the school with that intent. My guess is that 5 kids out of our class will show up. Granted, that's an extremely high percentage when we only have a little over 10 anyway, but we'll see.  Another baseball game tonight, and no one thinks it is important enough to tell the trainer when it's time for the bus to leave. 5:00? 5:30? 4:00? I've been told all those times, all by different people. My guess is somewhere between 5:00-5:30, so that's when I'm showing up. If the bus is gone and I get in trouble for it, it's not like there was ever a consensus on when I was supposed to show up. If I do end up going, it will be close to 11:00 before I get home (game ends ~9:30, 1 hour drive home, then cleaning up the stuff and actually driving to my house).  Well, I guess that's about it. Time to entertain myself for about an hour and a half and then leave to go up to the school.         "

I know this sounds tre gay, but I'm on the Entertainment Committee and since we've done Bagel Bowling 3 times already and we've cooked breakfast for people more often than we care to remember, I thought it would be kind of fun (and stupid) to have people get into it and rock the mic on the rooftop of our parking garage here at work.  And they bought it.  There are going to be around 9 performances today starting at 1pm.  We'll be eating mouthwatering hotdogs, delicious chips, and savory soft drinks.  I'm performing with a friend here at work and it's going to be abso-fucking-lutely crazy.  There will be pictures and I will post them here on Pandyland, since I know our ratings have been slipping.

3536864,male,Student,"       I played volley ball today at our church picnic.  First time i've really played.  I was the underdog... really underdog..i had some good moves.  Then there are my other moves, that really stank.  Thus underdog.  I'll get it though.  Only lost three out of eight games. Wasn't to bad. I played for 3 hours! On that note, it wasn't bad at all. Today my family and I went to mazzio's to eat pizza (oh, who 'da thought?) and cake.  We had to get our own cake, but we were going to have to get a regular sized cake for $17. But a guy from our church (who was also getting a cake for his dad's birthday) found the same kind of cake, and we could get two for $14.  Nice deal.  So we got that,(ryan and I) and we got frappachinos with the leftover money :-) On to mazzio's we went!  There we watched tennis, and european football...and made fun of french and german people.  I also had a trick played on me which is to close for me to talk about right now (it cut me deep ;-) ) and i messed up someone's fun by making the language portugeuse...yah.. Anyways... I went to a different church with my family this morning, it was a good sermon, and the people are very nice.  The old people anyway, the youth, i think, are all mute.

3477296,male,Student,"                 Stupid english open book essay tomorrow. Fortunately it's last period so cram, cram, cram at lunch and during DT. Unfortunately, i know what the topic is which i reckon is worse than not knowing because now you have no reason to screw it up. And to follow that up, on Friday i have an english speech assessment task on mental illness. YAY!! Researching topic on social attitudes towards mental health. Managed to get a 113 page analysis of social attitudes in Britain. Teacher wants all written references so she can mark them. This is seriously going to screw my printing bill at school. Anyway today was a pretty average day. Nothing happened in school. More stuff happened outside of school. For example on the way to sport, i learnt about ilia's attitudes towards Russians, Jews, Cossacks, Czechens, Hindus, Asians, Americans and basically every other race on the planet. I won't write it here coz it might offend some people, but if you want to find out go talk to ilia about his list of hated people and what he plans to do to them. Also got dropped 5m during rockclimbing because Rajiv is retarded and can't belay for nuts. Muscles still aching in body but not as bad as before. At least now i can sneeze, laugh and cough without to much pain. Ben hasn't been to school in the last two days and that means there is something seriously wrong with him. Hopes he gets better soon! While reading the paper i learnt about the magic mathematical ratio of 'phi'. This ratio is 1:1.618. Why am i rambling about maths? Because those who possess this divine ratio are beautiful. Not just average good looking but like really good looking. [Orly must have it (glances at Fel)]. So how do you find out if you have 'phi'? Go to www.beautyanalysis.com, download a phi mask and stick it over a picture of your self. I haven't done it yet so go do it and post a comment on this blog (don't have to mention whether your beautiful or not). Just to make all the ugly people (glances at andy) feel better, if you don't possess phi it doesn't mean your ugly, just average looking, which is ok, so don't stress. So go to the site, play around with it and leave a comment! Have fun pplz!        "

589736,male,Technology,"           This is not ideology.  This is the Democratic Party trying to find something that will stick when attacking Bush.  Arguing over what happened (or did not happen) 30 years ago is just personal attacks.   The last time I saw such vitriolic hatred (and I think Johnathan, as a neutral observer would agree) of a political figure was the late '90s with the Republicans hating Clinton.  I've got to tell you, it does not do much good.  It doesn't even make you feel good in the long run.  That does not make me ask the question of Ben and Mir (and any other Bush haters), what is it that makes you hate him personally?  And now as I type this, I just heard on Rush of a potential bombshell against Kerry that is being reported on the Drudge report.  Something about recent infidelity.  I have no other information, but, even if it is true, so what?  As long as he did not lie about in the course of federal/state/local investigation, it is between him and his wife.  I saw Edwards on the today show, and even though he did not let the ANG issue totally die, he did say that this election needs to be about much more than attendance records.  Hallelujah!  Now if BOTH sides will let that happen, we might get to have civil discussions about our disagreements on the issues (taxes, spending, education, defense, etc.)          "

2844168,female,Marketing,"                  Everything's Just Beachy    Tropical Sister Chicks Day 2!!  This morning Karon and I dropped Ked off at work and with picnic lunches and sunscreen in tow we headed for the beach! We went to Fort DeSoto beach rated by someone nicknamed 'Mr. Beach' as the 2nd best beach in the U.S. for 2003 right behind a beach in Hawaii. It was a beautiful day in the low 80's with the perfect mix of sunshine, clouds, and light breeze. The beach was sandy white and well maintained. The water was chilly at first, feeling like Lake Michigan in July. We arrived around 10 a.m. and had the beach mostly to ourselves. By noon the area had started to fill up but was far from crowded. We started to walk the beach and in addition to seeing a tiny 1/2 inch crab we saw various shells and lots of sand dollar pieces. I said to Karon, I bet if we walk out there a little we'd find whole sand dollars. Not long after that we saw a lady walking with a handful of sand dollars and she said people were finding them out where I thought we would. So Karon and I waded out about thigh deep and started walking. We ended up getting totally drenched thanks to the waves and bending over to pickup our treasures. We walked away with 15 very cool sand dollars and some of the largest shells I've ever picked up on a beach. I found one sweet shell and was all excited until I pulled it out of the water and realized it was still alive!! Some black squishy mussel was opening and closing his mouth in protest to being picked up. I tossed him back. We had a great time relaxing and enjoying the great outdoors.  We came home after picking up Ked and decided to finish what we started last night. Karon added a few more blonde chunks to her hair and then Amelia got her blonde highlights. So much sun & fun!!  Tomorrow we're going to check out another beach!!               "

3536864,male,Student,"       Yahoo! I went paintballing today.  I woke up early(well,8:30 someodd) and walked around trying to decide if i should do nothing, or if I should do nothing in a different style. I went to tim's house and got there at around 10:20.  We didn't actually leave until around 11:00.  ...only becase JASON didn't get his co2 before he came. ;-) We drove back down to the woods we were going to play at, then unloaded our stuff, suited up completly, and walked, guns in hand, in search of the other guys we were playing with that had already gone out there. We reached a small clearing where we saw one of the guys motion to us and tell us that they were in the middle of hunting a small child.  YES he was playing too. He was just hiding, and he did have a paintball gun with him to defend himself.  Real short kid. We couldn't find him, so he gave up. Kind of backwards. Then i was going to test fire my gun because i hadn't shot it today. But no, of course, it didn't work. Safety off, co2 full, paint in the hopper, no fire.  So now i'm serioulsy peeved and annoyed. Peeved because it won't work, and annoyed because i don't know what's wrong with it and i don't know how long or how much it will take to fix it. Now it is getting towards noon and it is very warm and verry humid. So we decide to take to the woods. We find a nice spot that's shaded, and has a small stream running through one part of it.  And a swing was in the middle of a clearing there. A nice place for paintball. It wasn't really fair, because I now had to use a winchester paintball gun, that wasn't excellent, and one of my partners had the same kind of gun. My other teamate had a tippmann 98 with a lapco bigshot, and a stock. It was very nice. I also let him use my electronic hopper which allowed him to shoot really fast. The first game i was shot in the elbow while crawling\kneeling over the top of a hill. They got the flag that time. The second time we started on the other side, and i shot more. Still, no range. So i try to get closer. I crawl up towards this tree, and i'm in the underbrush so no one can see me. I'm also flat on the ground so it's kind of hard to crawl with a paintball gun. I get to my tree, and it just so happened, that if i lean any space at all to my left, I'm in the line of fire of an enemy.  Same story for my right. I eventually got shot in the knee by the little kid. He had a pretty good gun though. My other teamate, tim, was trying to flank, but he got shot right between the eyes on his mask from a Tippmann A-5. With a very accurate barrel.  But it was cool crawling because i was getting shot at. The paint splat on my friend's mask was awesome. He took a picture of it. Then accidentally erased it. So we shot his mask again. Then we did some defending stuff. Me, the little guy, and Jason with the tippmann 98, went over the stream and on to the other side. The enemy's job was to eliminate or cross the river.  I was the first to go. Naturally.  I was moving up to take down this guy right across the stream, but NO RANGE!! I accidentally shot tim. Hehe, he was reffing and taking pictures. Thus my profile picture. So then, the A-5 guy shot me with his amazingly accurate gun.  So i was out and had nothing else to do, so i swang on the swing. (oh yes, i swang) and supplied paint to people that were running out.  Then we walked back through a very hot path. (i didn't even wear my camo jacket. it was to hot. So i just went with my white under shirt.) back to a very hot car and drove home to a nice cup of cold water. So there is the epic of my paint ball experience in the woods. (hopefully not the last one)          "

4175778,female,indUnk,"       I do not typically go out a lot. I will meet my friends for Happy Hour, and I go to the occasional BBW hotel party, but I rarely go to clubs or bars on the weekend. Anyway, I DID go out on Saturday night. We went to a place called Yorkshire Pub (West Little Work &amp; Barker Cypress) for Kristin's birthday party which was hosted by Nicole. Kristin and Nicole are both part of a  urlLink BBW group  I hang out with, and I think they are both really nice. There are some women in the group who I think are questionable, but I think Nicole and Kristin are great. Back to the subject- I ended up having a really good time. This place is a karaoke bar. I did everyone a favor, and I did not sing...unless you count singing in my chair without a mic. I drank a few too many Cape Cods, so I was a little more obnoxious than usual. I usually wouldn't talk about such an uneventful night, but there was something that bugs me. There was a guy, Josh, who was there for his sister's birthday, and they were sitting across the dance floor from us. I noticed him looking over at our table during the night. I didn't necessarily think he was looking at me because there were a lot of women at our table. Anyway, Angie and Lisa (Nicole's friends) went over and talked to him sometime during the night, and I guess he told them he thought I was pretty. They didn't mention this to me until later. Anyway, later in the night everyone was on the dance floor dancing, and I got dragged out there. I usually never dance. I am not sure what the problem is. I have pretty good rhythm, but I freeze when I am on the dance floor. I start doing the Elaine (Seinfeld), and I point my fingers and kick my feet. OK, I am not that bad, but it can get ugly. Also, I kept stepping off the sides of my shoes when I walked (Thank you, Cape Cods!), so I did not want to be out there. So, I am out there getting my ass slapped by some girl (don't ask), and I see Angie pull Josh out to the floor. I did my best to get away, but I was stuck with him. This guy was cute, and I choked up. I ended up leaving the dance floor to go get another drink. My hands were actually shaking. I have no idea why. I am not the nervous type, and getting approached by guys in a bar isn't a rare occurrence. Something about the scenario Saturday night freaked me out. I didn't talk to Josh at all that night. I did not give him my number, and he did not give me his. I guess what bugs me about this is that I don't know why I clammed up. I think a large part of it is being put in the situation. Had I talked to him before the dance floor incident, I would have probably stayed on the dance floor. If he had come up to me later in the night, I would have talked to him. Alas, I think my personal insecurities played into it as well. I am still not entirely comfortable being hit on. Most of the guys I have dated will say that I am not the easiest person to get to know. I question everyone's motives, and I trust no one. A lot of people have said I come off as a bitch or a snob (I certainly can be), but I am a pretty likable person once someone gets to know me...at least I think so. I don't know why I make it so difficult on myself. For the past year I have had no desire to date anyone. The last guy I 'dated' made me feel like absolute crap when it ended, so I realized I needed to focus on myself and not someone else. I have taken care of a lot of the things that needed changing a year ago. I feel like I finally have the time, energy and desire to invest some of myself in someone else. Still, I make excuses. I plan on moving back to Austin soon, so I don't want to get tied to someone here. That's just a reason to put off having to meet someone until I move. I am sure when I get to Austin I will just be too busy to date. I am not looking for marriage, but I would like someone to care about...and I would love the attention. :) So, Josh, if you read this, sorry I was an idiot. And since he won't be reading this, I guess putting this on the internet somehow makes me feel better about the situation. Blah.     "

Yes, it is painful for me to say, especially here among such esteemed colleagues, but perhaps ridicule is the medicine I need to help me stay on the road to recovery.

I have fluid in my middle ear (like middle earth only not as trendy), and it won't come out.  I say 'huh?' all the time now.  I'm supposed to do this pressure manuever 10 times and hour.  So far, I'm about 28 behind schedule.  Earmaster HAL says 'Duf, don't mess around, go to a specialist.'  I am obsessed with fear that I have an ear infection though.   2. ...went to the dentist?   Oops, I'm a little overdue. I think it was August for a cleaning.  I was told I have a very clean mouth.  My reply?  'Kiss my ass you fucking bitch!  Shit!' Seriously though, I am an obsessive flosser.  And I promise to stop cursing on my blogs starting [whore!] now...   3. ...filled your gas tank?   I think it was just before I left for Columbus, so Monday the 16th.  I am obsessive about filling my tank when it gets to the half tank point.  My friend Jeff Schrag (from McPherson, Kansas) taught me that obsession.   4. ...got enough sleep?   That's easy, August 21st, 2001 (the day before my daughter was born).  I am the worst sleeper ever, so it doesn't matter.  I obsess too much and cannot fall quiet enough to sleep.  Rumor has it HAL is also a poor sleeper.  I heard that she goes to bed around midnight, then tosses and turns until about 5:00 a.m and eventually gives up.  That's what I heard anyway.   5. ...backed up your computer?   This backup computer thing.  How does that work?  It sounds interesting.   You would think that I would be obsessive about backing up my computer because (a) I have lost documents before (ask HAL), and (b) I sometimes put things that are very important to me on my computer (like poems and short stories).

1708471,female,indUnk,"           I think my world has revolved around Sesame Street this past quarter. For those of you who don't know I am writing my 14 page college writing paper on how Sesame Street has impacted education and children. Anywho I have never felt so much like I've repeatedly written the same thing over and over, there are like 2 main ideas and 2 main points, but other then that nothing.  I have gotten a lot of quotes from the books and I must say that looking at all those pictures and singing along to the songs do make me of so happy! I am now here to pass some of these fabulous quotes along.  'Smarter than a speeding bullet furrier than a powerful locomotive    able to leap tall sandwiches ina single bound!!! Look... up in the sky! It's an eggplant! It's a meatball! It's... SUPERGROVER!'    'We superheroes bruise easily, you know.' -Supergrover.  'Me love to look out the window at night. See all the pretty stars- twinkle, twinkle. You know what moon remind me of? It remind me of great, big, delicious cookie!' -Cookie Monster  'I love pigeons more than anything else in this world- besides oatmeal.' -Bert  The best song ever: Rubber Duckie. Rubber Duckie you're the one, you make bathtime lots of fun. Rubber Duckie, I'm awfully fond of you yo-yo-dee-o. Rubber Duckie joy of joys, when I squeeze you, you make noise, rubber duckie you're my very best friend it's true. And I can continue, but I'll pass.  So right now instead of doing homework I am sitting here telling you about Sesame Street which is said to be very educational. If that is case then I have just contradicted that statement by making myself, and probably you too, dumber. In fact, throughout this whole research paper, I think it has been reading about puppets and chosing my favorite one at the age of 16 that has probably wasted my time more then anything, but then again if you read those quotes and see how random they are, everyone should understand why I stay amused.   I am now going to leave you with a song most everyone should know: Sesame Street. Sunny Day, sweepin' the clouds a way. On my way to where the air is sweet- Can you tell me how to get how to get to Sesame Street? Come and play ev'ry thinks a o-kay. Friendly neighbors there thats where we meet- Can you tell me how to get how to get to Sesame street?  And clearly this is a valid question, I would truely like to know how to get to Sesame Street, and well how to find a 3rd fricken book on it!! Seriously there are only 2 and I have them both!!

2821801,female,indUnk,"           So, this girl on myspace posts the following from Michael Moore: Monday, March 17, 2003 A Letter from Michael Moore to George W. Bush on the Eve of War  George W. Bush 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. Washington, DC  Dear Governor Bush:  So today is what you call 'the moment of truth,' the day that 'France and the rest of world have to show their cards on the table.' I'm glad to hear that this day has finally arrived. Because, I gotta tell ya, having survived 440 days of your lying and conniving, I wasn't sure if I could take much more. So I'm glad to hear that today is Truth Day, 'cause I got a few truths I would like to share with you:  1. There is virtually NO ONE in America (talk radio nutters and Fox News aside) who is gung-ho to go to war. Trust me on this one. Walk out of the White House and on to any street in America and try to find five people who are PASSIONATE about wanting to kill Iraqis. YOU WON'T FIND THEM! Why? 'Cause NO Iraqis have ever come here and killed any of us! No Iraqi has even threatened to do that. You see, this is how we average Americans think: If a certain so-and-so is not perceived as a threat to our lives, then, believe it or not, we don't want to kill him! Funny how that works!  2. The majority of Americans -- the ones who never elected you -- are not fooled by your weapons of mass distraction. We know what the real issues are that affect our daily lives -- and none of them begin with I or end in Q. Here's what threatens us: two and a half million jobs lost since you took office, the stock market having become a cruel joke, no one knowing if their retirement funds are going to be there, gas now costs almost two dollars -- the list goes on and on. Bombing Iraq will not make any of this go away. Only you need to go away for things to improve.  3. As Bill Maher said last week, how bad do you have to suck to lose a popularity contest with Saddam Hussein? The whole world is against you, Mr. Bush. Count your fellow Americans among them.  4. The Pope has said this war is wrong, that it is a SIN. The Pope! But even worse, the Dixie Chicks have now come out against you! How bad does it have to get before you realize that you are an army of one on this war? Of course, this is a war you personally won't have to fight. Just like when you went AWOL while the poor were shipped to Vietnam in your place.  5. Of the 535 members of Congress, only ONE (Sen. Johnson of South Dakota) has an enlisted son or daughter in the armed forces! If you really want to stand up for America, please send your twin daughters over to Kuwait right now and let them don their chemical warfare suits. And let's see every member of Congress with a child of military age also sacrifice their kids for this war effort. What's that you say? You don't THINK so? Well, hey, guess what -- we don't think so either!  6. Finally, we love France. Yes, they have pulled some royal screw-ups. Yes, some of them can be pretty damn annoying. But have you forgotten we wouldn't even have this country known as America if it weren't for the French? That it was their help in the Revolutionary War that won it for us? That our greatest thinkers and founding fathers -- Thomas Jefferson, Ben Franklin, etc. -- spent many years in Paris where they refined the concepts that lead to our Declaration of Independence and our Constitution? That it was France who gave us our Statue of Liberty, a Frenchman who built the Chevrolet, and a pair of French brothers who invented the movies? And now they are doing what only a good friend can do -- tell you the truth about yourself, straight, no b.s. Quit pissing on the French and thank them for getting it right for once. You know, you really should have traveled more (like once) before you took over. Your ignorance of the world has not only made you look stupid, it has painted you into a corner you can't get out of.  Well, cheer up -- there IS good news. If you do go through with this war, more than likely it will be over soon because I'm guessing there aren't a lot of Iraqis willing to lay down their lives to protect Saddam Hussein. After you 'win' the war, you will enjoy a huge bump in the popularity polls as everyone loves a winner -- and who doesn't like to see a good %@!$&-whoopin' every now and then (especially when it 's some third world %@!$&!). So try your best to ride this victory all the way to next year's election. Of course, that's still a long ways away, so we'll all get to have a good hardy-har-har while we watch the economy sink even further down the toilet!  But, hey, who knows -- maybe you'll find Osama a few days before the election! See, start thinking like THAT! Keep hope alive! Kill Iraqis -- they got our oil!!  Yours,  Michael Moore To which I responded: Sorry, but Michael Moore is a  urlLink fat, smelly, douche bag  To whit she responded:  ok, so why don't you like m.m.? I think the guy tells it how it is most of the time. Did you know disney is censoring his movie? How do you think this reflects on our rights? You prolly like Bush too don't you? Just curious to know what you think And my response?  urlLink Censored ?  Sorry babe.  His 'stunt' aside, Disney is not a governmental organization. They have every right to NOT pay Michael Moore for his movies. Just like you have every right not to watch it. Disney, acting in their own best interest, decided that they would not *distribute* the movie (which they've now gone back on I might add). Technically, Miramax funded the movie, Disney owns Miramax - that's the extent of the relationship. Disney doesn't have Moore tied up in some backroom, or have a gun to his head telling him what to (and what not to) say. If Miramax, or Michael Moore, for example, wanted to distribute the movie on their own dime, no one is stopping them. Moore's a multi-multi-multi millionaire. If he wanted to get it done, he could. Think Mel Gibson and The Passion of the Christ - worked good for him, right?  In any case, all I'm sayin is do your homework if you're gonna come back with a retort. Or, you could just swallow every hunk that fat fucktard spews out for your consumption without questioning a word of what he says - despite the fact that he admits he goofs on his sheeple (see link above).  BTW, what I *think* or how I *feel* has nothing to do with Mr. Moore being a big fat liar. THAT is a fact. ;) Stupid Bitch:0    Fat Kid:1         "

Littlest diva has recovered from her week-long fever.  Only last night did I find the source of the fever - she's cutting a new tooth near the back of her jaw.  Molar I guess.  So, now I know what caused the fever, and I know I can look forward to another week long fever episode soon - when the tooth on the other side starts.  My office space is almost done.  Its sort of miraculous how these men have managed to tear down walls and what-not and put up new walls and such.  Its like the bathroom never existed at all.  I should have my *new* desk and chair by next week and will move in then.  My ankle still hurts and is still slightly swollen.  Not 8-months-pregnant-swollen, but swollen nonetheless.  And I discovered a lovely bruise of deep deep purple just below my right ankle, which explains why this sprain hurt more than any other I can recall.  I thought I broke it, but no.  Just a sprain.  I'm getting caught up at work, and I've managed to sell 4 tickets to the  urlLink Cystic Fibrosis Miami Wine Opener  - only 96 more to go!

3370336,female,indUnk,"       At my dad's this weekend in Henderson.  I've had an okay time, but there seems to be a lot of tension between my dad and Lisa.  Not sure what is going on...maybe it's Matt living here-I don't know.  All I really do know is how it affects me-its very saddening.  I don't think I could really deal with another break up.  They all mean so much to me.  If someone was to have told me five years ago that my parents would be divorced, and I would love new people, I would have laughed at them and contritely waved them away.  Shit happens, things change, and life moves on.  I think I can say that though I'm not happy about the divorce, I am happy with how I have grown because of it.  Wouldn't it suck if I couldn't learn from bad situations?  Yup-I think so.  I told God three days ago, that I would pray every day for a husband, until he brought me.  I'm serious about this one. I'm fed up with waiting.  I am having a hell of a time managing my temptive urges-boys are all around me-and even the ugly ones are beginning to look quite attractive.  I'm not lonely-it's just once you've opened the forbidden box of sex-it's hard to not want to open it again.  I have been succesful thus far in praying for a husband...but it's only day three...we'll see in two or three months-heck a week :)  I'm getting along much better with David and Mom as a couple.  I love them both and have really come to respect each of them together and separately.  I am not sure why it took me so long to accept David.  Mostly because I thought he wasn't good enough for her, based on his looks. He's certainly not what I consider good looking-but his intelligence and compassion certainly make up for it.  Sure-he's heavey handed and loud mouthed-but then again-maybe I am too.   eXpedition: is okay-I'm a little disenchanted with it at this point-and having a hard time sticking in there.  I would love to move on to another church that is much more stable and established.  But it seems to be my pattern that I leave when it gets too tough-so I'm just asking God to help me through the hard time.  God-if you read this-which you are probably doing now-please help me.  I need you to move in my friendships at eXpedition and help me to better serve those in the church.  I want to bless those around me-but I can't if everyone hates me due to misconceptions presented by tainted opinions.  Help me to love Courtney. If I could beat her up in a dark alley somewhere, I would-but I know that's not right, and deep in my heart I do love her, it's just hard to show it when she insists on hurting me. But God is bigger than my feelings and my fleshly desires.  I'm missing Drew like crazy.  He hasn't written me any email-not called-no letter-nothing.  I feel like discarded trash-and it's hard to understand why he doesn't communicate in some manner.  If he does love me, even as a close friend, why doesn't he contact me? Doesn't he realize that, that is what friends do?  Guess not.  I did send him two emails-the first was really encouraging-the second relayed irritation and frustration.  I plan on sending him a letter to let him know how I really feel, but I need an address first.  I was watching Tombstone tonight, and there is a scene at the end where Jody looks in the mirror after a show.  She's not looking at herself, but instead looking into the future with regret, regret that she didn't tell Wyatt exactly how she felt, that she didn't care about any of his faults, and just wanted to spend the rest of her life with him.  I identified greatly with that look-and felt a twinge of pain in the pit of soul, that I too, would one day feel this.  God-please don't let this happen to me.  Well-guess that's enough for now.  I love my life God-I just want someone to share it with.  Love-Faith         "

3912317,female,indUnk,"        Sometimes I would like to be alone all the time, the peace is unrelenting and it's so....precious. Then people come inflitrate my world and it all starts. The constant bitching, the orders, the excuses, the insults. I wish I could shut off my ears to all their idiosyncrasies. It's poison, that's all it is. It ruins me and makes my happiness decompose as rapidly as some dead animal, it's slow, the acrid feelings linger for ages, and it's torturing. You just want it to end, the end is the biggest reward. It's like being on a bad acid trip, it's wonderful in the beginning and then you crash, it's terrible. (From what I know and have seen, it's not like I use drugs). Such a change of moods makes you angry, unreasonable, and then they take it out on me. It's not a great feeling to have your mother call you a 'demented freak' or an 'antisocial idiot'. That's what leads me to write these depressing entries. I don't enjoy it, I want to write about something happy for once. I don't want to come off as pessimistic, I love life. I just want to enjoy it and be free from everyone. I am made happy everyday by someone but it's a terrible feeling to know it won't last once those people decide to come here and ruin me, everyday. Then I just have my few happy memories to hang on to, and that gets me through the day. Someone saves me everyday. =) Yeah, those are my few little rants for today.   I'm tired.           "
3649763,female,Banking,"                 Sometimes when you look for something so hard you don't see that what you need might be right in front of you. We all live with perceptions...about ourselves, others, the world..spend a lot of time classifying the same. In the pursuit of all things wonderful we forget the wonder in what we already have. Nothing is sweeter than realizing that old adage...it's not having what you want...it's wanting what you have.  I'm taking time for me for a change, and it is not an easy thing. I am so used to being many things to many people. But what I keep getting told is that if I don't take care of me first my efforts are pretty much wasted. Funny after 33 years to be told my expectations of myself are too high...when I have thought I just wasn't trying hard enough. Ah if only...if only what I don't know...but...ahhh if only.  I love finding the beauty and art in everything...the way the sun shines through the leaves on my apple tree just so. The brilliant diamond sparkles as it dances across the water in the pool. The flowing motion of the ripples across the pool as a giggling child spins around as fast as she can in the water. And her laughter...I still think it's one of the best things I have ever and will ever hear. Right up there with hearing her sweet voice first thing in the morning reminding me I am loved. It's been far too long since the depth of my love for her has moved me to tears...and here I sit reminding myself that she is the reason I need to be whole and happy.   Take that extra minute to find the beauty in your day, that one small reason no matter what it might be...remind yourself it doesn't all have to be stress and hurry. Cause this ride around the sun will be as brief as the ones before and the cosmos needs your spark of light to be full of everything that made you smile.  Cheers      "

3536864,male,Student,"       This week is crazy. I'm being a staff member for vacation Bible school at my new church. That goes from 9am-12:30. It's not to bad; the little kids are good, but when you get to fourth and fifth grade it's time to bring out the whip. I have mucho grande child herding skills under my belt, two little brothers the same age, and I helped with Sunday school for two years at my older church. There is a fine line between being overly nice, resulting in anarchy; and being horribly mean, which results in tyranny. Which isn't all to bad, but then they don't obey you until actually move towards them threateningly. Some people find a small niche in the middle of that line, and they can control people firmly, but be a popular person at the same time. For instance, if i said, 'you need to sit here, ok?' and they do it without question. That's the niche every child herder looks for. I was offered to go to a game night tomorrow night, but I don't think i'd be able to participate in anything. I stayed up way to late last night. Then i only got 5 hours of sleep. urk. I was very tired. So I got home and passed out on the couch. Great experience. I didn't really pass out...it was a figure of speech. The grand finali is friday night at 6:30. At TBC's old building. Now Memorial Bible Church. Finally, the thing i won't enjoy the most week is raking my entire back yard. Oh joy. Dead grass litters it, so i go out to rake it all in. Still have to do it, but it's really hot right now. I'm doing it in heats..hehe, heats? Heats as in a race heat, a heat as in it's hot heat. Man, that heat must be getting to me. Oh well, time for the third heat. I'll come back and post some even more corny jokes later. Chaio!          "

My discontent is apparent, because I know longer can conceal it. Everything is out of hand. Life is a gun, loaded with a single bullet. You pull the trigger knowing that eventually it will go off, but, you have no choice. You must continue... click, click ..Until the  click  is stifled. Then, its partial relief, its over. No longer do you dread the moment it will go off. I pray for that day to come soon. He broke me down, coaxed me into trust, and removed all barricade I had, to keep the 'Harmful one's' out.

883178,male,Fashion,"           Since we're coming up on the end of the year, why don't we start a series of BEST of 2002 lists?  We can do one a week until the end o' the year.  This week:  BEST 5 CDs of 2002  in no particular order.  1.  N.E.R.D  -  In Search Of...  These guys are all over the map.  One part R&B dance-y music, another part lyric mischief.  Not only are their songs catchy, very well produced and delicious, but they're pretty damn funny.  It's refreshing to listen to music that doesn't take itself so seriously.   Relax girl...sip some of my slurpee...   2.  Lo Fidelity All Stars  -  Don't Be Afraid Of Love  Yeah they're sort of a house/dance/techno band...but they're so much more.  After the loss of their lead singer (yes, they sing, too) the future looked bleak for the Lo-Fis.  No worries, mate.  Their newest effort is solid.  Rock solid.  If you're going on a road trip and you need a kick-ass soundtrack to drive to, scoop this one up.  3.  The White Stripes  -  White Blood Cells   So I've already sung their praises and I've only owned the CD a day and a couple hours.  If I've already listened to it like 8 times, does that tell you something?  I like their whole gimmick, too...pretending they're brother and sister when they're really ex-spouses.  Am I icky if I say I think Meg White is kind of cute in a gothy, creepy girl way?  Methinks no.  4.  EELS  -  Souljacker  Okay, so I learned about these guys backwards, buying their newest CD and working my way back.  Shit...I even bought a burrito for HAL in exchange for their debut album.  Well worth every inch of tortilla.  Their newest (and consequently my oldest) effort is a kick in the mouth of crazy-ass beats, sound lyrics and mouth-watering rhythm.  C'mon...in the first song entitled 'Dog Faced Boy' the chorus is...  Ma won't shave me, Jesus can't save me...  Pure bearded genius.  5.  Emiliana Torrini  -  Love In The Name Of Science  Well...technically this CD came out in 1999, but I got it late last year and...well, I still can't get enough of it.  She's from Iceland (big bonus!) and I saw her open up for Dido at the Xcel Energy Center.  Considering she didn't have much in the way of a set-up for playing such a huge venue, I was totally blow away by her.  One part Bjork and one part Dido is the best way to descibe it and that still doesn't give her justice.  Anyway...not an easy album to find, I had to bribe the woman at Tower Records in Philidelphia to sell me her copy...but well worth the effort.         "

Not a comfortable place.  But I gave in to the warm-and-fuzzies that accompanied the first time I saw 'guest blog' and 'Blaine's' in the same sentence.   I want this to be an open forum for the excahange of ideas, even if the first return salvo is some wacko fantasizing about all the ways he'd like to 'skin (me) while I sleep, then toss (my) bones in with (his) morning broth'.  Faris ('not like the lazy infidel bueller' he stresses) will make his Blaine's Hospitable Habitat debut some time in the next day or two.    I apologize in advance.

The seared scallop paired with the Carneros Cuvee 1991 was amazing, and the Oddysey paired with the Veal and Truffle jus... divine.  It was an amazing dinner, and quite an enjoyable evening all together.   Having the French Ambassador's party dining just a few feet away added to the fab-ness of the evening.  (No, really ~ the French Ambassador was there!)  This weekend is busy.  Going to the salon tomorrow to get my brows shaped; want to look my best for the Big Apple.  And I'm going to a Kabbalah course - on interpreting dreams on Sunday.  Meeting a friend for brunch on the north of the beach, and then going together to this course.  If nothing else, it should be interesting if not enlightening.  And at some point I have to take my two little divas to the see the newest Disney animated film, 'Finding Nemo'.   I've  They've been looking forward to this film for months!    Have a fabulous day, dear reader.   And an even better weekend!   And now, for the  urlLink Friday Five   1. What do you most want to be remembered for? ~ My ridiculously, shall we stay retarded, unrealistic optimism?  2. What quotation best fits your outlook on life? ~ 'There's more than one way to do everything.'  If I can't figure out a way to get what I want or need, I try looking at it from a different angle; there's always a way.  Or, 'To thine own self be true.'  3. What single achievement are you most proud of in the past year? ~ Getting a grip on my budget while still managing to keep a roof over my head, and the heads of my little divas.   4. What about the past ten years?   Bringing my girls into the world, and watching them grow.  They truly are my pride and joy.   After reading that, I reconsidered.  My girls aren't an achievement, more of a blessing.  Acheivements from the past 10 years would be learning to love unconditionally, learning to be strong and stand up for myself, learning how to take care of myself and to love myself unconditionally.   5. If you were asked to give a child a single piece of advice to guide them through life, what would you say?  ~ 'Nevermind what people say.  Believe what you know in your own heart to be true.'  I've had to say that more than once to my girls lately.    Diva out.          "

1103575,female,indUnk,"       I was just re-reading Walk Two Moons, by Sharon Creech.  Its a book I was madly in love with when I was 5th grade/middle school, back when I had no friends, and did nothing but read books day and night.  As I was re-reading this book I realized how much I really picked up from those books I read back then, like as I was reading this one particular part... '  She slid into the seat next to me and said, 'You are brave.'  To tell you the truth, I was surprisied.  You could have knocked me over with a chicken feather.  'Me?  I'm not brave.'  'You are.  You are brave.'  I was not.  I, Salamanca Tree Hiddle, was afraid of lots and lots of things.  For example, I was terrified of car accidents, death, cancer, brain tumors, nuclear war, pregnant women, loud noises, strict teachers, elevators, and scads of other things. But I was not afraid of spiders, snakes and wasps.  Phoebe, and nearly everyone else in my new class did not have much fondness for these creatures. But on that day, when a dignified black spider was investigating my desk, I cupped my hands around it and carried it to the window, and sit it outside on the ledge.  Mary Lou Finney said, 'Alpha and Omega will you look at that!'  Beth Ann was as white as milk.  All around the room people were acting as if I had single-handedly taken on a fire breathing dragon. What I have since realized is that if people expect you to be brave sometimes you pretend that you are, even when you are frightened down to your very bones.'  and I {I, Rachel} when I read that in fifth grade greatly admired Salamanca Tree Hiddle and wanted to be brave like her... and I have not been afraid of spiders, snakes or wasps... but I did sort of switch frogs/turtles/lizards  for the snake part... I'm not all that fond of their beady eyes and forked tongue.  And people  have that same reaction to me walking around with bugs on my hands.    "

766556,female,indUnk,"        My babies are growing up *sob*   This morning, the littlest diva announced that she wanted her big sister to take her to class.  Not her mommy, her sister.  I was dumbfounded; I responded with something like, 'Really?  Are you sure?'  She was sure alright.  So instead of parking and walking her to class, I pulled into the drop off lane along side the school.  I was still in disbelief, but they popped off their seatbelts, gathered their things and hopped out.  I had to beg for a goodbye kiss from the little one - she was already half way out the door.    I watched with tears welling up as the two of them walked hand in hand into the school, the littlest one's lunchbag dangling down past her knees because she's just so small.  If I had a camera I would have clicked off a picture of this; the day my diva-ettes worked together without me to guide them.    WAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!  Diva out.         "

589736,male,Technology,"           Two off the wall and totall non related questions for the off the wall and mostly non related people on this Blog  1)  Is Bravo known as a gay network?  (ala Lifetime for women and Spike for men).  I was flipping around the other day and saw that Bravo is showing reruns of the West Wing.  I saw adds for a couple of shows, Queer Eye for the Straight Guy and Boy Meets Boy, or something like that.  It just seemed odd to have two shows like that on one channel if they weren't trying to be known for it.  2)  What happened to Christine Todd Whitman?  I heard something about the Senate confirming a new head of the EPA last week.  Of course, Bush, in his infinite wisdom, pulled yet another Republican governor to fill the slot.  So much for the majority of the states being governed by Republicans.  I think half of them are now, or have been, on Bush's cabinet.         "

3647746,male,Education,"           Josh Marshall made a  urlLink  post   to his blog last night that is very tempting to believe. He talks about the tone of the Democratic National Convention as being starkly different from the tone of the campaign amongst the candidates for the nomination.  Much has been said in the media about how the rhetoric of the DNC has been surprisingly light in terms of attacks on the Bush Administration, and Josh offers his explanation in two points:   First:   On the surface, the fiery rhetoric and animus of 2003 and early 2004 were directed at President Bush. And to some degree of course they were. But the punch of that rhetoric derived not so much from Democrats' antipathy for President Bush as from a pitched battle, almost a rebellion, within the Democratic party -- the grassroots of the Democratic party insisting that Washington Democrats were compromising with the president over particulars when he was leading the country in a direction that had to be opposed across the board. Fiery rhetoric against President Bush was fiery rhetoric against compromise and accommodation with him. In other words, it was to a very real degree aimed at other Democrats.    Second:   Anger is often, and rage is almost always, an emotion rooted in powerlessness. That was certainly the position of Democrats in early 2003 (on so many levels), though less so as the year went on. These Democrats don't feel powerless. The mood is one of cautious optimism that they can drive the president from office, that the wind is at their backs.   So, Josh thinks the change in tone is a sign of unity and optimism.  That certainly is a glass-half-full way to interpret it.  Yet, while I'd rather be optimistic, the polls showing Bush and Kerry in a dead heat, despite the glaring fact that the Bush Administration has dragged this country through the gutter, erode my ability to believe that the Democratic Party has what it takes to beat the Republicans.  What Josh sees as a new found confidence, I see as fearful, tip-toe dancing around the swing voters.    The point that anger is 'almost always' rooted in powerlessness, while likely true, rules out the potent combination of anger and confidence, righteous indignation, that occasionally surfaces during struggles for freedom and justice.  As a model, I look to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.  MLK spoke the plain truth and there was no way to hide the legitimate anger he felt about racism.  He had utter confidence that he was right and deep faith that he would succeed.  I find it deeply ironic that the most successful movies in America are blockbuster action films with heroes who act out of righteous indignation.  It is a classic American icon, yet somewhere along the line the Democratic Party decided that this formula doesn't work.  Yes, the media jumped all over Howard Dean for his post-Iowa pep rally.  The key, however, was how the Dean campaign, and the Democrats in general, reacted.  Rather than defend the emotion that Dean was showing, which I contend was much more that of enthusiasm than anger, they apologized and toned it down.  This is classic pacification, and the worst part is that it is self-inflicted.           "

3433630,male,Technology,"       It’s crazy how you never know!  You never know whose watching who’s listening and who knows more than you think.  There is no trust amongst family and friends any more.  If there ever was?  I wonder sometimes if that trust that I felt and that bond that I imagined was there ever was.  Was I the blind one?  I believe I was.  I now see a world of liars, cheats, thieves and back stabbers.  No down to earth trust.  Is there even a need to be trusted?  I know that I once had that need.  I would go to the bitter end to prove my loyalty; and what happened I got fucked.  Bent over and shafted.  I chalked it up to bad decisions and tried again.  Once again I'm bending over the railing.  Chalked up, another bad decision.  Down the road I am more cautious now, I watch closely the ones that I least expected…but I was still blind.  I was blinded by my own weakness to want to trust and be trusted.  It may be a natural human need, but it’s a weakness. You see my take on it is everyone is out for themselves.  They will lie and play up to everyone and anyone including the ones they love.  For some reason they have been trained to think like this and it’s unfortunate.  They lack the ability to see the power that comes with numbers, trust and loyalty.  It’s b/c of this trained way of seeing and thinking they will struggle maybe not in the physical means of life but in the mental means.   But what about me?  What about the person who wants to trust and wants to be trusted and loved?  You want to know?  I become cold.  I become trained to no longer let you in.  I develop methods to trick you into feeling like I’m close and you can trust me cause I am only out for myself.  I learn to drown out that desire to trust and be trusted.  I drown out the desire to love and be loved.  I become all those people I despised for hurting me.    I see now, that’s how it happens.    Well fuck that!  I’m better than that.  I am not you!  I am not the lying, cheating, stealing prick you are!  I will be successful and I will not forget those that helped me get there.  I will earn my trust as they will mine.  I will have a team and together we will accomplish great things.  I want to and will see those close to me (though there are few) happy.  I will be able to trust again.  I will be trusted.  Although I will not be fucked b/c you never know who’s watching, who’s listening and who knows more than you!  I will have a family and I will hold them dear to me and teach them all that I can about life.  I will be there for them no matter what the circumstances!  I will never turn my back on them and I will show them a love that no material possession can ever take the place of.  They will be able to trust me……this will be my success!          "
936098,male,Student,"       Yesterday I went crazy getting completely registered for the first semester of English IV at BC, and afterwards Sara went crazy changing to the English class that I was signed up for, so now we both have it from 9:40 to 11:09 every morning until early August. About ten minutes ago Chess said, 'Happy summer. Enjoying no college?' I ran into my room and slammed the door.  The class was very easy today. . . . And since I don't know where my mom is or what she wants me to be doing right now, I'm going to post about it, elaborately. The teacher was completely new, and called it 'Brazoria College' on accident, and then corrected herself. The teacher seems pretty nice, but at the same time relatively incompetent. Kind of like Mrs. Munson. Except Mrs. Munson wasn't very nice.   I think that people in general are pretty fascinatingly terrible so here are some interesting and excessively detailed descriptions of the people in our class: There's a woman in our class who's probably around 30 who told the teacher a lot of terrible stuff, since we spent the whole class period talking casually. First the woman went outside for a smoke break. Then she said, 'You do NOT want to see me when I haven't been smoking.' And she told us about how she had been smoking since she was 14, she spent her senior year in alternative, she knows where there are whorehouses in town, she did drugs and alcohol but found them less addictive than cigarettes, and then comes the most illegal part--they started talking about police, and the woman said, 'how do you think I got off my probation early? You pay off who you gotta pay off.' Everyone in the class was pretty disturbed and/or alarmed by her saying that, and she said it in a very matter-of-fact way, like someone would say, 'my pickup was making fun noises this morning, and then I found out the fanbelt was loose.'  The kid who sat in front of us was a senior at B'port, and he said that he was going to be a pre-med student, and then he cussed a few times, talked to no one, laid his head down like a kindergartener, and walked out twenty minutes early.  There was a girl who had made a face when she was three years old, ignored her mother's warnings, and got her face stuck that way. She was looking around the room while people were talking, and for the entire class period, her face seemed to say, 'why isn't anyone licking my shoes?'  The guy who sat next to Sara was really goofy. He said he was home-schooled. He had his shirt tucked in, he was unshaven, and he had pretty big glasses. He was passing around the role sheet, and he slid it into Sara's water, which fell over, and he laughed in a really goofy way.  Well, I'm done talking about those people, and I'm pretty sure that was enough to keep anyone from ever looking at this blog again. So there you go.  Sara's at work right now, and I want to help my mom (who is home now) but she's on the phone, and has been for about ten minutes.  Who thinks that Sara's blog and my blog should get married? Any opinions? You wouldn't have to read about the same day more than once. Ehh? Ehh? Okay, I give up. I'm going to find something else to do.    "

3373204,male,Technology,"       I like the fact that they killed the President.   Why is it that the Vice President is always the asshole though? Is it impossible for a movie to depict the President as being an asshole? I mean we know they are assholes, the present one being the case in point. At least the President in the movie seemed to be an idiot. Very realistic on that score.   Dennis Quaid is an idiot too. Believable as a rugged arctic adventurer, harder to believe as a real human being.  I just hate the way he acts. I think he is a boring person in real life.   Other than that, I thought the movie was great. It's always nice to see stuff blow up. The scene in LA with multiple twisters was awesome. That and the waves of the sea frozen so it looks almost like a desert. Isn't there some saying about the desert being the sea of the land... Or something equally paradoxical? Donnie Darko is in it which was weird but added to the endearment factor. What the hell is his real name anyway?  urlLink Jake Gyllenhaal  is Donnie Darko, IMDB owns your ass.  Well worth my Rs. 150.

3022585,female,Education,"       Yesterday, Bunny Day, I was driving out to my sister-in-laws' parents' house for Easter dinner (yeah, we're all close like that) and noticed store after store closed.  Her parents live in the suburbs... (sorry, I just puked) and there is mega store juxtaposed to mega store juxtaposed to posh mall along the way to their house.  This is how it went down inside my head:  'Hmm.  Why is Best Buy closed?  What time is it?  It's only 4pm.  Oh yeah, Easter.  But Best Buy is corrupt and charges restocking fees.  Why are they all of a sudden holy?  More like Best Butt to me.  OK, there are no cars in front of World Market, Home Depot, ah Kroger, there you go guys, sell those hams.  Target is closed.  What the?  McDonald's?  You mean I can't go get a Big Mac cause the Easter Bunny is busy.  What?  Oh, Wal-Mart.  Good, dear sweet heathen Wal-Mart.  Damn, rednecks like to shop on Easter, that parking lot is full.  Is Sam Walton rolling over in his grave?  Nordstrom, good for you.  You show them how to fear God, close you store.'  Um, I guess I've never been out on Easter Sunday to realize that we still observe this holiday by barring heathens from their purchases.  I guess I am now a heathen.  Well, good, really, I don't believe in judging people for their religious beliefs anyway so um, a heathen I may be, but I still hang out with non-heathens and other heathens and I love them all.    I think it says a good deal about a company to close on a religious holiday in this country, being that the majority of corporations seem to pray to the God of the U.S. Mint rather than the Almighty.  I didn't even go to church yesterday.  This is the first Easter that I haven't been to church.  I just wasn't down with going to Mass with the rest of my family (the only Catholic is my sister-in-law) cause they don't think I'm Christian enough to drink their wine (Catholics do it right, there is no grape juice up in their joints).  So, I slept and joined the fam. for the important part, the food.  OK, so this is all blasphemous of me to say.  But, I probably would have gone shopping yesterday being none the wiser.  I had no idea we were that pious a nation what with Blue Laws being banished within the last 20 years.  Alright, well, you go people, stand up for something, except of course Kroger and Wal-Mart, you guys keep selling on major holidays cause you never know, I might need to buy some ice or a fishing pole at the last minute.

(bugger)  &nbsp; still, the idea of patterns and order is one that i feel is worth exploring. it is my contention that we understand things simply because we recognise the patterns involved. this generally comes from experience - learning to 'see' by interpreting repeating patterns of light as 'objects', for example - and so when faced with the unrecognisable we want to understand the logic of the pattern. if we are able to recognise familiar patterns in everything then we understand everything, but only&nbsp;in terms of what we already knew. if we strive to form and learn new patterns with every new experience then we understand everything, but with nothing in relation to anything else. the true skill then is to recognise both the familiar and the familiar in anything new:  what of this have i felt before? what of this have i never felt before?  &nbsp; i am rambling. i shall leave you with a list, and then be off to play solitaire.  staples in my stapler: 1 pictures of alex on my wall: 2 pieces my sunglasses are currently in: 4 pills left: 5 pictures of dido visible from where i am sat: 7 balloons on my desk: 12  n.

2844168,female,Marketing,"                 Well, I spent the majority of today staring at this computer screen. I'm ready to turn it off and head to bed. I got up this morning and started working on two books my  urlLink father-in-law  gave me while we were in Michigan. Over the past year I've become the editor for his self-published booklets for his  urlLink ministry . These latest two he needs ready to take with him to Malaysia and Singapore in a few weeks. He and another long-time family friend and Christian magician, Paul Ricksecker, will be ministering in churches throughout the area as well as teaching at a few conferences. I knew Dad needed these two books ready as soon as possible so I worked on them most of today, and he and I exchanged e-mails throughout the afternoon. I think we should have them all ready by the end of the week. Please pray for Sheldon and Paul as they prepare for this trip that God will guide them as they study and prepare their materials and that He will open&nbsp; many doors to share the gospel, that hearts will be opened, and that as a result of their training the locals will be even more equipped to share God's Word with their neighbors.   Oh - Word to all my Elk Lake homegirls and guys - I gave a cd to Nate last Saturday with all my Elk Lake pictures. Just ask him for a copy if you'd like!   Well, that was my day.

883178,male,Fashion,"             Monday One     Tell me about your first love (& loss).   Matt was a goofy, Irish, dark curly-haired guy.  He made me laughthats what I remember first drawing me to him, and thats what makes me smile when I occasionally think about him today.  He also wrote the best love letters.  Matt gave me roots; he gave me wings.  I had no roots or anything to leap off of (or compare to) before him.  All I had was the burden of my dreamsMatt taught me how to build a bridge between my dreams and who I am.  Let me say that again: we must build a bridge between our dreams and who we are.  Thats why most people never find love, because our dreams get in the way.  Love is about acceptance.  Its about settling.  Settling is the real triumph of love.  Its  easy  to find a great man if you can find one and if he loves you.  But  real  love for  real  people; that means loving  despite .  After we broke up I couldnt get out of bed.  I just kept thinking, if only I had kept a different perspective, if only I wasnt so youngI would understand the significance of needing to have it end later.  But at the time, I just wanted to die.  But then, after recovering from mono (oh, the dreaded kissing disease), something happened.  I went to class.  Everyday, I continued living, going through the routine, and suddenlya month, a summer, a year passed.  And before you knew it, I was ok.  Sure, I missed Matt.  The sadness was gone and it was ok, it made sense to me.  Not the actual break up, but the way things get left behind, the way things get out of youlike the way some things pinch your skin and cling to you forever, but others wash away, just disappear without a rinse.  People, things, places, they can just wash away.  And what is left is a sense of peacefulness.  And relief.          "

I was the first born and an apple of my parents' eye.   2. What is your favorite number?   Who cares?   3. Vanilla or chocolate?    Is this a reference to my taste in men?  They are both appealing and I have had fun with chocolate, but usually go with standard vanilla.  Wait, flavors of ice cream?  A mix of both, of course.   4. What section of a bookstore would I find you in?    Travel...I'm constantly planning where I'm going to go next.   5. What kind of mattress do you have on your bed? soft? firm? water?   Can you believe I still sleep in a tiny twin bed?  It's not that I can't afford a bigger one, and I also have the room, but the twin (w/o box spring) is so damn easy to move, I can't part with it.

Hmm.. not bad, my third game, and already i can rally the ball over the net. It felt good to hit something.  But later that night, a friend of mine asked me what was going on in my life.. i seemed grumpy lately. I don't know.. could it be work? A sense of uncertainty about the future, direction in life... etc? Whatever it is, I'm glad she noticed and took the time to chat. I felt much better after that. Did I ever say how grateful I am for friends around me?  Well, I am.  And I thank God for bringing them to me. And for my boyfriend too, who sometimes can be as blur as i am, but who has such a big, caring heart.  Hmm... thinking back abt yesterday makes me wonder abt the balance between being an independent woman and a woman who just wants to be cherished and pampered. (dependant on others in short!!)  Well, part of me didn't want to receive any help from others yesterday... it was more of like my pride talking i think.     'I am woman! Hear me   ROARRRRRR!!!!  '              Meow.

2821801,female,indUnk,"           More sickening  urlLink media bias  can be found here.  Want to know what I'm talking about?  Do your homework.  The current environmental policy calls for, if any retrofits are to be made, an ENTIRE overhaul of every system at a plant - making it fiscally impossible to do, so nobody does it.  Any small retrofit would trigger the rest of a plan needing an overhaul.  Ok, that was the old system.  The NEW/proposed law would allow plant operators to retrofit anything they wanted, one thing at a time.  Thus, eliminating the cost burden, and making it MUCH more likely that they'll do ANYTHING.    In my world, this equates to the 'old' system of rent control in santa monica.  Under the old system, rent increases for new and existing tenants were limited to some inflationary factor.  This led to people living on the beach and paying $400/month - where as landlords expenses were exceeding that inflationary factor, thereby eating into the spare cash flow the property generated.  Thus DIS-incentivizing landlords from investing any capital items (carpets, paint, renovations) into the property: 1) b/c someone will always rent it and 2) they can't support it financially.  Why spend $$ on carpets, if SOMEONE will live there, and you can't recoup the cost anyway.    Long story longer, the State amended that law, and said, on turnover (when a new tenant moves in) you can charge whatever is considered 'market' at that time.  So, we were seeing rents jump from $400 on that waterfront property, to (after redecoration) $2,000+.  Shit, some 3 bed/3 bath units in Samo go for $13,000+!  Under the new legislation of course.    To dismiss the gentrification issue, as long as tenants don't move out, their rents don't change.  So, voila, diversity.    SSDD for this power issue.  By making financially irresponsible policy (environmental act imposed under Clinton) one is able to assuage the masses.  While the law looks great on paper, never is it enacted in the 'real world' b/c it kills shareholder value in one fell swoop.  By allowing utility providers this NEW option, it allows them to remain profitable, and keep their constituency happy by letting them invest in their PP&E.    The Green party is a bunch of friggin idiots.         "

Like Jesus, though I would never presume to make my resurrection the salvation of the world.  The Fates have cut my thread in several places,  only to spin the shards of wool into a single yarn again.  Thus I have lived many lives, some of which are not mine to  live.  The voice ... a  paradox {or a lie} in of itself, had become my comfort food, and I yearned for it.  It was a comfort food like the most searingly hot mexican chile.  That was why...  Because we had no truth, Everything we were to each other was a lie, and I hate{ed} lies. {don't lie to me.}  You love someone for the little things you know.

4192173,male,Technology,"             Things post-laptop problems are starting to get back to normal a little bit. I still don't have my laptop back, but the initial shock of what I did to it (another time) has worn off. Again, I credit Irene for keeping me sane. However, my IPOD took a dive on Friday, which now makes me feel quite jinxed. This led to some time back at Apple in Soho, but the situation was saved by 'the IPod genius'. Also, thanks to Brandt, I was able to get 1500 or so songs, including some very rare ones BACK into my Ipod within a few hours. A minor crisis saved. Frustrated, Irene and I spoiled ourselves with an evening at Jules, a wonderful French place on St. Marks.  Post dinner, we spent some brief face to face time with Peter Saintface, who was in good spirits and certainly enjoyable to chat with. He now has his songs for this album and I expect we're going to get some greatness out of him!  The next morning, I was feeling refreshed, so I ran to the studio early  to work on more bass and surprisingly, Ash was only an hour and a half late. He had issues with the basslines in MORNING AFTER THE LIFE BEFORE. His belief was that while what I played in the song worked for it, it was more of my typical 'hook style' bass playing than it was rythmic. Repeated listenings to the song confirmed this to me. Instead of me doing it myself, I suggested Ash record it as he was the one who pointed it out and obviously had been thinking about it. Also, my other motive, no pun intended, was to get him more invested in the song from the bass side, as he will be the live bassist.  Needless to say, it was interesting to watch him work. I've only jammed with him on songs as opposed to putting him in front of me, as a producer, and having him work out a part. Instead of full sections, he worked the chorus out a few measures at a time; eventually writing one longer piece. It's very mathmatical, very detailed, very technical and very successful. It was totally fascinating. I've worked with the guy for years and he still comes up with new ways to puzzle me. After I left, I believe the two of the laid down the rest of that song.   Then, Ash, Brandt and I reworked the bridge to CREATION PHASE, a section that had been troubling everyone in the group, except me of course. Brandt had a vision for this and even tracked Robin playing some random drums based on what he had heard in his head. When I heard the drums earlier in the week, I dismissed it as being too MARCH OF THE PIGS, but when he edited them into the song and presented a guitar part, it was very obvious that this was more akin to The Who. And this is NOT a bad thing. Ash played bass and I played   a quick Hook-style lead over this bridge and we hammered it out in what seemed like 3 minutes. It's awesome. I dream of it. I'm happy. In my old age, I've gotten good at letting my collaborators push the songs a bit to make things better. I've become less stubborn and am going to have a much better album because of it.  Later, while shopping on 5th Avenue with Irene and Dan Hamill, we ran into Robin and her man Damon. It was a birthday, so Happy Birthday to the best bandmate I've ever had! We discussed the real band name for ass cobra, which led to Mr. Hamill making a wisecrack that we will get tons of mileage out of. See you at Golden Unicorn, bitch!  The evening was capped off with a screening of THE GIRL NEXT DOOR, which should be huge, but won't be, but was nonetheless enjoyable. The kids in the movie, in particular one of the sidekicks (who Irene has dubbed the new John Cusak), really carried it. And the presence of AJAX from the Warriors, James Remar, never hurts.  I spent Easter immersed in all things Clone Wars. And speaking of Jedi, I ran into the star of my NYU senior thesis film, SUBURBAN JEDI, this morning. HIs name is Kosak, I love him and it was good to see him. He is strong with the force, still, especially if he moves to France. So jealous.  Note to self: Plan vacation!  F         "

4192173,male,Technology,"             Oh Darling, you know I've not forgotten you. It's just that while I live a fun life, there's only so much you can write about without boring the reader. I mean, how much can write about my excitement about Groovie Mann joining RevCo? I sincerely doubt you'll want to hear me discuss my views on Wrestlemania (though if Matt Gentile gets us into the show, he will truly be a MOGsuperstar). I doubt you want to hear about the large amounts of sushi Irene and I downed tonight.  Anyway, things are moving along here. I saw alleged members of the MOGpac at Ash's Birthday gathering the other night and this was a partial treat. It was good to catch up with the RJ's of the world (RJ is my bizarro twin in the life of Ash who happens to be an excellent musician and Ash's writing partner in the world of electronic music), and it was good to see Ash in good spirits. It was also a good opportunity to thank Ass Cobra bassist Charles from saving those bitches from a life of aggression covers (this is a JOKE). However, the absence of both Matt Gentile and the Kidd was felt, though, as the MOGpac lacked its heart and soul, respectively.  Meanwhile, we enjoyed STARSKY AND HUTCH for its homoeroticism (had to see it with G) and hated JERSEY GIRL for its hetroness. Affleck is just flat out lame and Kevin Smith disppoints as a director as he ages, though I am excited he is writing and directing THE GREEN HORNET.   I think I've seen Saintface a few times since we've last spoke. Again, full on. They take the stage on Long Island for the first time this Friday. I fear for them as I have been on many a Long Island stage and rarely has it been enjoyable. Anyway. Saintface. Impressive, ok but where's the album. Well, my gossip is as follows. It's just been reported to me that a certain lead singer from said band just walked out of The Birdcage with a keyboard belonging to certain lead singer who is typing this. Something about 'strings' and then 'mixing'. Stay tuned.  I work daily on my vocals for HF2. It is a slow process, more based around developing the feel for each track. I sing along quite a bit. Thursday there will be more drum recording. This excites me as we are so close. I can't wait to get this album back into the studio where I can get into a routine.  In the world of I-Music, i discuss further work with Jared though nothing set in stone at the moment. I have to send some loops in for his project with Spyby. Hope they like what we did. LeoV23 writes to inform me that progress is being made on the V23 retro CD. there might possibly be a new song that they will finish for this release. I have begged to remix. My agent/manger says I have become the industrial Ryko-disc guy.  In the meantime, I remain happily domestic. I watch wrestling and Teen Titans, I play RISE TO HONOUR, which is making me mental, and I occasionally buy my girlfriend things for our kitchen. I find myself listening to Chris Connelly's new project EVERYONED and enjoying it immensely. I am looking forward to reuniting with the MOGpac spinoff group Team Obscene to watch Mania this weekend and I am dead psyched about Irene and I seeing Avenue Q on Broadway this weekend.  And then there's the cinematic side of my life, which I can never speak of, though many of you would love to hear. I did get a CONSTANTINE crew jacket, which is nice as hell. 8 years of script notes and all I got was this jacket (and a possible cameo in the movie). Anyhow.   I will report back to you soon about more drums, my new cel phone, and other assorted goodies.  F           "
589736,male,Technology,           In the balance....  'The fate of Lopez's pink engagement ring -- for which Affleck paid an estimated $1.2 million -- was not immediately clear. '         
883178,male,Fashion,"           Panda, I'm in total compliance with you on both counts.  I thought  Jackass: The Movie  was sheer genius.  I don't remember laughing so hard in my life...well, in the last couple of years anyway.  I personally thought the end thing (after the credits) with them as old men was the funniest thing I've ever seen.  I'm a big fan of exessiveness.  Anyway.  As for Kevin Smith latest foray: I haven't seen it and I highly doubt I ever will.  I struggled through  Dogma  which was such an over-rated piece of crap, I kind of felt cheated.  Was I offended by it because I'm religious?  No, and for the record, I'm about as agnostic as they get.  I just thought the performances were awful (Linda Fiorentino was horrible) and that snootchie-bootchie shit is for the birds.  After seeing 'Shitma' in the theatres, I swore off seeing any more Jay & Silent Bob movies.  They pantsed me on Mallrats and I felt taken again with Dogma.  Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me. The funniest thing is, ol' Kevie Smith peaked at Clerks and that was the flick he did with the smallest budget.  Oh...if anyone is wondering how  Gangs Of New York  is, I can sum it up in a couple of words: Waste Of Time.  Easily one of the worst (and most boring) movies I've seen in a long time.   Catch Me If You Can  was pretty good, though.         "
3176655,male,Engineering,"                 I have no idea what is up with people today.  Elliott in the Morning (DC101's morning show) was a veritable conucopia of nut jobs.  For 30 minutes they talked to a 60+ year old Barber in Rockville, MD who likes to wear a bra and fake 44 D's while he cuts people's hair.  So this fella, Luis, dressed up and became Luise, I felt bad after a while 'cause they were going a little far, but it was funny.  But they were also pressing him about being gay even though he said he wasn't.  I mean there is a difference between cross-dressing and homosexuality.  I thought that we all figured this out with J. Edgar.    And then afterwards some people in traffic called in and said that two girls with a camera were hanging out on the side of the road with a sign saying 'Show us your twins.'  People are so nutty some times.  I don't know if people actually obeyed their wishes, but I'm sure it was a site to see.  I wish that would happen when I'm in traffic, 'cause I get so damn bored.    Anyway, I think I'm now in love with Nick Hexum from 311(drool).  I'm gonna go fantasize now.    Oh yeah, and if anyone has a life that they can spare I'll give ya 50 bucks for it.             "
4192173,male,Technology,"             This warm and sunny morning started off with a chance run in on the corner of 17th and Park Avenue with the wonderful Robin, who as I learned in this brief time spent with her, is quite 'busy and jangly'. Where I'm from, these are good things, but obviously not in certain dim places. I always enjoy my time with my multi-talented bandmate and friend. If I can take one thing from this conversation, which included everything from comparing ipods to discussing school and New Jersey, it is that I wish the aggression a long eternal slumber in the annals (not anals, Dan Hamill), of history. See my previous post regarding 'missing being in a band'. I'd rather go back to High School, or maybe early college cause there were girls then. Anyhow, in the words of Greg Dulli, actually some French chick he recorded...goodbye motherfucker.  Onward, Ho's.  Then next time I checked email, I received this epic from a fan, who after much praise for the Chemlab album, writes:  'Alright, this was not the original intention to write this message to you, it was because of the Hype Factor EP which is just not leaving the 'right-next-to-the-stereo-pile', I'm not even thinking about putting it on the '2nd-next-pile', no f'n way. I'm still caught in the beauty of it. I have told you before, it's true and by the time you might have gotten tired of people telling you such BUT, F.J, it is such a won-der-ful record, simple as that. Also, I recently discovered I never saw the beauty lying in your voice before this effort? I've tried a dozen times to write this sentence without it sounding so damn gay but I failed, can you xqs me? I maybe miss the appropriate words (no native speaker here, sorry) but damn it's such an honest effort, I can onnly presume this was the most personal piece of music / lyrical work you've ever done? By the way, 'thieves' (which I'm sure isn't only my favourite on 'the distracted lover') made it right into my all-time-favourite-achy-breaky-sour&sweet-luv-tunes-ever'. What an amazing, amazing song. Thank you so much, F.J., I msut be getting repetitive, excuse me, but you know, I kinda had to let you know. Again.'  Well, if I know the new album will sell ONE copy, here's the dude that will buy it. This letter makes everything we do worth it! And no I haven't grown tired of people telling me that they love DISTRACTED, the problem is, the only person who tells me that is Brandt! ;-)  This could be a good day.  F         "
2012853,female,indUnk,"       Just in case anyone is wondering.. (no one probably reads this anyway but to put my mind at ease)..  I didn't end up going out on the day of my birthday (which I said I was in my last blog before todays bloggs.) Because none of my friends could make it  - I ended up going out with my boyfriend and we saw Lara Croft Tombraider and ate Vietnamese in George st .. it was a nice date, and funny cause earlier on in the day a work friend had presented me with this huge buinch of flowers, the most beautiful, romantic flowers ever, two bunches of light and dark pink tiger striped lilys with green leafy stalks.. (shes a close girlfriend too) and wherever we went that night all the women everywhere would look at the flowers, drool and sigh and then look at my boyfriend as if he was the most lovely guy ever!!! Hehehe it was funny!!!     There was one point in the evening when I had to go to the bathroom after the movie and left boyfriend holding the flowers outside the toilets, and this girl approached him when I was inside, and gushed over the flowers and him!!! Heheh.....   But last night was a nice surprise.. it was about a week since the actual birthday, and last night went to the pub with school friends, as my friends from work couldn't make it..   But they surprised me and turned up and it was great!! They are the best, and the presents they got me are so nice I love them..   So thats how my birthday panned out.. (not that anyone is reading this... ??)            "
589736,male,Technology,"           My point is not that the Ten Commandments are old, but rather that they were traditionally authored by Yahweh, the god of the Hebrews in the Old Testament, and to refer to them as a starting point in our legal theory is to make inseperable our society's laws and the aforementioned deity.  Such a link would be quite alarming to citizens who do not worship that particular god.  Unlike many other countries, America is not a nation of culture, religion, or kin.  It is a land of immigrants, regardless of who got here first.  Any attempt to establish a connection to a single, unifying religious tradition immediately excludes hundreds, perhaps thousands, of others, and immediately weakens what I consider one of my country's strengths.  The history of human thought is rich and vast, and is more than capable of providing all the justification necessary to hold a society, or a nation, together.  I see no need to choose one artifact from one religion to serve as a back-up for already existing laws.  It is every family's right to display that artifact -- any artifact -- in its own home, or, alternatively, in any private gathering place.  Such an artifact can inspire as much or as little thought or dialogue as the private individual sees fit.  But to place it in a government courthouse suggests, to me, that our laws and the god of the Old Testament are inexorably connected.  And I just can't find a compelling historical, philosophical, or, for that matter, religious reason that it must be so.  Note:  My argument is focusing on the suggested *connection*; I do not feel the judge in question was directly prohibiting the exercise of any particular religion.  Though I doubt he'd mind very much.         "

In college, I had a girlfriend (well, more than one, but I digress), we'll call her BP.  One night, drunk at a party, BP got mad at me and threw a bottle of Heineken at me (Duf ducked, bottle breezed by).  I ended it because she clearly had an anger management problem.  She called me a lot and even waited for me in my bed one night (scary).  Eventually, we reached an understanding (or so I thought).  One afternoon, I was at home watching Jeopardy (With Alex Trebek - a Canadian) after a vigorous academic schedule.  BP comes down the hall walking out of my roommate's room.    BP:   I just *&^%$# your roommate. Duf:   Who was better? BP:   He was by far. Duf:  That's funny, your mama said I was.  BP remains silent then throws herself at Duf and beats him about the head and neck.  Offending roomate removes BP from the person of Duf.  Eventually, Duf, roommate and BP reach an understanding.   2.  Have you ever lied to spare feelings when breaking up with someone?  No, I pretty much tell the truth.  However, I have broken up with someone from the (edge of the) bed of someone else so that I would not 'cheat.'     3.  Stevie Wonder says 'there is supersitition.'  Discuss.  Stevie hasn't been so right since 'Master Blaster.'  I try to get the same hotel room if I was in it during a good business trip (or if it has a great shower) (Hal calls me princess for this).

883178,male,Fashion,"            More than you ever wanted to know...   I had a great, great vacation.  There are so many places in this world that I hope (and plan) to visit.  But London is just...  very hard to not visit at least every couple of years.  For me, it's a combination of nostalgia and new discoveries.  I had some worries that this trip would be a flop - we were only going to be there 4 nights, we had a Mom with us, we all had our own 'must do' list, etc.  Thankfully, my lowered expectations paid off.  My cohorts were Angela (lived with us for about 2 months while we were in the UK, and also my roommate for this stay), Christine (a roommate the whole time I lived there), and Susan (Christine's Madre, truly a good sport when it came to our antics).  Without further ado, here's the blow-by-blow:   Wednesday  We landed in the A.M. and made our way into town and hotel.  The plan was to stay up until at least 8 or 9 pm (easier said than done), so to resist the urge to nap we dropped our bags off and headed down  urlLink Oxford Street  for shopping.  The main mission for Christine and I - getting bras at  urlLink Marks and Spencer  (it's kinda a cross between Target and Marshall Fields).  It's a sad fact that American woman cannot find quality undergarments.  Luckily, we can supplement with trips abroad and no one does it better than M&S.  Mission accomplished, we went next door to  urlLink Selfridges  (closest equivalent here - Bloomingdales) and wandered around to a cafe for coffee and cigarettes.  Revived by caffeine and nicotine we stopped in a few other stores and then headed back to the hotel to unpack and put our feet up (promising we'd keep each other awake).    I should mention here that we had the blessing/curse of forethought, and as a group decided to buy a CARTON of cigarettes when we were going through duty free.  Cost savings?  Check.  Waking up each morning questioning our sanity?  Check.  That said, here?s my closed circuit to DJS - dirty cigarettes in Europe are absolutely delicious.  Formally checking into the hotel was a bit of a fiasco (there's a reason the U.S. gets raves for customer service), so Angela and I went to the other room 'till ours was ready.  Christine, Angela and I watched  urlLink 'Father Dowling Mysteries'  on the telly (get it??  I was in England! 'telly' - he, he, he!!), while Susan napped.  Nothing like random American television (with  urlLink Tom Bosley , no less!) to add to the surreal world of jet lag.  After Father Dowling figured out the mystery of the maid being held prisoner by her employers, our room was finally ready, so we got our keys and unpacked. Quick showers and slaps to the face were administered and we headed out to dinner.  When I was buying my  urlLink Tube  ticket the (initially crabby) man on the other side of the glass asked me if I was American.    'Yeah' I replied defensively, expecting a rant.   'What do you think about  urlLink Kerry ' the man asked, 'I think he's going to go all the way!'  I paused, completely taken aback.  Sure, I know Tony Blair, but I couldn't guess who the opposition leader is.  'I, uh, don't know much about him.  It looks like he'll be the one to challenge Bush, though.'  Way to put that Political Science degree to work, HAL!! 'I think he is just like John F. Kennedy!!' the man excitedly exclaimed. 'Well, they are both from Massachusetts' I weakly replied. 'I hope he's got what it takes to beat Bush' 'Yes, he is like Kennedy, he will beat Bush!' the man smiled.  I then asked the man where he was from.  'Bangladesh' he said.  Then I went and caught my train, guiltily making a mental note to look up Bangladesh on the map when I got home.  Back from dinner we went to the 'Glenn Miller Bar' at our hotel for a night cap.  It quickly became our trip tradition to start and end each evening there (it was open 'till 7am, while pubs close at 11pm).  Back in our rooms by 11pm we congratulated each other on staying up past our goal our and fell asleep watching 'Sex And The City'.  God bless the BBC.   Thursday  Day 2 was our sight-seeing day.  We started at the  urlLink London Eye  - a new attraction for all of us.  Basically, it's a huge Ferris Wheel on the Thames, very close to Big Ben.  It takes about 25 minutes to go around in it and you can see just about everything in London from it.  It's ironic that a city with very few clear days would create such an attraction, but it worked out for us - from there we walked to the  urlLink Tate Modern  (art) gallery and crossed the Thames on the 'wobbly bridge' - the  urlLink Millennium (pedestrian) Bridge , a feat of British engineering (installed as part of the millennium celebrations) that was closed for much of the time following the grand opening because it shook and became unstable in wind.  Recently 'fixed' we braved it and lived to tell the tale.  That night we went to the play  urlLink 'When Harry Met Sally' , recently opened and starring  urlLink Luke Perry  and  urlLink Alyson Hannigan .  It was a crap show (but the good news is, it only cost $75 apiece to see it) with some smart bits.  I thought Luke was (surprisingly) good and Alyson (surprisingly) not good.  However, Luke's performance was greatly improved when he jumped out of the post-coital bed and flashed us his ass (sorry, 90210 aired during a seminal time in my life).  I'm here to tell you - Dylan's still got it!!  After the show, we went back to the hotel bar.  Around midnight, Christine and Angela pulled the lightweight routine and went up to bed.  I stayed down with Susan and we were joined by a drunk Irish dentist named Paul (he was in his mid-fifties).  He bought us a round and started hitting on Susan.  Then he asked us what we thought (or as he'd say it, 'taught') of John Kerry.  He also added that he thought Kerry was like John F. Kennedy.  Not surprisingly, he's just as popular with the Irish as he is with British immigrants from Bangladesh.  After an hour or two of Paul telling us how much he loved American woman and making love to woman (one assumes nationality is not important), Christine came down in her pajamas looking for her mother.  When we introduced Christine to Paul, he said, 'aye, Christine, I think your mother is a luhhv-ley woman'.  Figuring we were alive and relatively safe, she headed back to bed, but not before Paul could ask, 'is your father upstairs as well?'  Once we safely untangled from Paul, we called it a night.   Friday  I was on a mission to get stilton cheese as a gift for dad, so Susan and I grabbed breakfast at the hotel (and managed to avoid a hung-over Paul, eating there as well) and headed to  urlLink Harrods .  Once there, we also stopped downstairs and saw a creepy Princess Diana/Dodi Fayed memorial (Dodi's dad owns Harrods).  The memorial consisted of pictures of the two, flowers, the diamond ring (very bling) that he gave her the night they were killed, and most bizarrely, the dirty wine glasses 'preserved' from their hotel room.  It was almost like a religious shrine with relics.  Very 'ewww'.  Afterwards, we met up with Christine and Angela and did a little more shopping.  Then we did the ultimate girly 'four girls go to London' thing - we had high tea next to  urlLink Kensington Palace .  After that, we were ready for a night of true (non-tea) drinking.  Last year Angela met 4 blokes from London (get it??  I was in England!  'blokes' - he, he, he!!) while on a trip to Spain.  We met up with them (and a few of their friends) at a  urlLink pub  and then we went to a  urlLink club  full of Eurotrash.  The music was loud and bad (I distinctly remember ?Ice, Ice, Baby? being played).  I talked to a guy from Russia who?s lived in the UK for 9 years.  When I asked where he was from, he said 'Moscow'.  'So, NEAR Moscow, then?' I replied.  'Yeah, it's sort of the New Jersey of Moscow' he said.  I asked him if he'd been to the States, and he said no.  I guess that they show 'The Sopranos' on the BBC.  I made the mistake of going to the toilet, sorry, 'loo', that made the toilet in ' urlLink Trainspotting ' look spotless by comparison.  As if the floor wasn't bad enough, the attendant kept screaming about a girl who had just thrown up all over a stall.  Lovely.  The oddest thing about it all was that all I could think of was 'I'm too old for this' and 'I don't do this enough anymore'.  After many more drinks we left the club and I introduced our British hosts to the distinctly American tradition of the pinky-swear (as a sign of their commitment to visit us in the States, presumably so we can return the hospitality, though we don?t have an exact translation of the evening over here).  In the interest of full-disclosure I am told by my traveling companions that it?s at this point that I announced (or screamed, depending on who you ask), 'Bloody Hell!  Where's our cab?'  My question must have gone unanswered as we then started the walk back to the hotel (graciously accompanied by our hosts), stopping half way for take-away Chinese food and eating it in an alley.  Is there anything better?  Then we finally got in a cab for the rest of our journey (serenading our cab driver on the way).  At this point, the wise choice would have been bed, but we went with plan B - the hotel bar.  After another round there (hollow legs, I guess) I said good-bye to the last two of our hosts.  When I got up to my floor the newspapers were already there and I thought to myself, 'God, I love London'.   Saturday  When I awoke the next morning, I thought, 'God, I hate London', and Angela looked at me, laughed, and said, 'Bloody Hell!  Where's our cab?'  I returned a quizzical look, and shortly afterwards we had a knock at the door - someone nicely pointing out that the room key had been left in the door the night before.  Just like anyone who's hung-over, I was thrilled at the prospect of hopping a train to  urlLink Borehamwood , the town at the north end of London where we lived oh-so-long-ago.  But nostalgia tour '04 was going forward.  We went to  urlLink St. Albans  first (a little north of Borehamwood) and walked around in a daze, still trying to shake off the night before (or maybe it was just me).  Then we headed to Borehamwood and ooh-ed and ahh-ed as we passed each shop, reciting each memory, and certainly coming across as insane to the locals.  We had a pint (alright, a half-pint, we were trying our hardest) at our old pub,  urlLink The Hart and Spool .  We walked by our old house, and then back to the train and to London.  Earlier that day, the  urlLink big rugby match between Ireland and England was played (in London) .  We knew this because we almost saw someone killed in the Tube over it (Ireland won).  There was also some very foul language, too harsh for me to publish here (plus, I have no idea what they were saying - the British have very elaborate words for 'cocksucker').  In my humble opinion, there are better ways to die then getting beaten to death over a rugby game.  There is a reason why the UK has very restrictive gun laws.  We had half of Ireland staying at our hotel, so later that night the bar was like St. Patrick's Day times 10.  For our final night, we headed to the other side of London for an Indian meal (in the east end there is an area called  urlLink Brick Lane ).  We got horribly lost, and it wasn't the type of area to get lost in.  Thankfully we managed to figure our way out before the restaurants closed for the night.  On the Tube ride home, Angela started talking to a group of dread-locked teenagers.  They bonded enough for her to start dancing on a train platform while one of them did a beat-box.    Sunday  On our final morning, we sleepily and almost silently caught our cab to our train and our train to our airport.  And that was it.          "

4192173,male,Technology,"             Acumen brought the pain to NYC and the way I am feeling this morning, the pain has been brought. First off, thanks to The Significant Other for putting up with the madness even though she had to be at work at 7am this morning. She probably doesn't read this, but she is appreciated. Having 5 guys crash in our tiny pad is not the most logical or easy.  Because of the graduation party for Ciao Baby and his sister, S.O. and I were late for the acu-gig. We missed the DJA? set, but got the full brunt of the rawk. I was quite pleased with the set list, especially since they played my old favorite, fuckface, which came out around the time the acumen/aggression (back when it was me and PH) pally-dom started. Such memories. I think. Anyway, the new songs are good and despite the lack of the ILC material, I was happy to see them for what they will never understand was a good and appreciative crowd for NYC. Also, I remain a huge fan of the Acumen rythmn section. Dan Brill blows my mind on drums and I'm not just saying that because he was sporting an aggression T-shirt onstage. He's no Robin though, but someday maybe he can try to be as good ;-)....  It was nice to see some familiar faces, like the kids from the message boards and thanks to Aaron the Pak for buying Irene and I some drinks. It took him 7 years to get around to it, but he did it, even though he is from a town made fun of on Sex In the City. the shock of the night was running into Charlie from Form, who just moved to NY from Dayton (Charlie and his bandmate Paul did a great remix for us on our newest single). And to Charlie, also, thanks for the drink.  Late night drinks were had locally, which of course led to the usual debates/discussions/rows, etc. and which of course leads to the one thing men need in the morning..Egg bitches. You can email Jason Novak about that one.  And now, a round of apologies....  First, to Matt Gentile. Acumen played 'Gun Lover'. I was told they weren't going to. Forgive me. it was good.  Second, to Ryan 'The Sarcastic Bastard', who drank sour low fat milk in my house. I can't feel THAT sorry for Ryan as he CHOSE to be the merch guy for Acumen. That's masochism enough. No wonder why he's drinking whiskey at 11 in the morning.  Ok, gotta clean this place up now. rrrrr.  F           "

3511107,female,Education,"                 Life in the NYC certainly has taken its toll on me.  It is obvious by the title of this 'blog' that I am an outsider to New York.  I was born and raised in South East LA and all of sudden, I find myself living here in New York, the Upper East Side to be exact, for almost an entire year.  The reason why I came here is to teach.  I teach a bilingual Pre-K class in the South Bronx and it hast got to be the toughest job I have ever had in my life.    The reasons why this job is so difficult I will sure to reveal in future blogs.  In the meantime, I chose to focus on why my time here in New York City thus far has been bitter sweet.  It has been bitter sweet for many reasons, some superficial, some most definitely quite the contrary.  Amongst the most superficial reason I can think of is the weather.  Can't it just be freakin' sunny for one day without there being a random snow or thunderstorm?!  A reason which is a bit more profound is that, although I am physically here in NY, I am mentally and spiritually somewhere else, and now, I am not sure it's California that I lack.  What I lack is some sense of stability; a sense of security which New York has certainly taken away from me.  More so, I have become a much more cynical and vengeful person while I have been out here. I think that it has to do with the fact that every freaking day, I am confronted with the realities of the injustice that is prevalent in the world as a whole.  What makes injustice particularly unique in the U.S. and in New York City is the following.  How could poverty be so severe in the richest country in the world and one of the richest cities?  What is worse, is the racial and gender polarization that is to be found when one juxtaposes the two side by side...  I find it especially problematic living in an affluent neighborhood in which I am often mistaken for a service worker.  Motherfu**ers livin' in this neighborhood have become so accustomed to seeing people that 'look like me' serving them that they automatically assume that my presence in their space is not one cohabitation, rather, servitude.  I saw fu** them!  Yesterday I read an article in the New York Times that basically suggested, 'If you believe in that meritocracy bu**sh**, for working 90 hours a week, you still get to be dirt poor, sexually harassed, wash clothes that you could never afford, and basically can't do sh** about it cause we'll call INS on you...WELCOME TO THE AMERICAN DREAM.'  If it isn't obvious by now, I am pretty angry at the system in which we are forced to function in.  Perhaps for those that are a part of the dominant class, it is not so problematic given that they benefit from the exploitation of others.  But for me it is and something needs to be done.  That something will be explored in another post.               "
883178,male,Fashion,"            Let the Juggling Begin   I may have mentioned someone in an earlier post  - Orbitz Guy.  OG called me yesterday and after talking on the phone for almost 45 minutes and asking me out for Tuesday night, I suggested we just meet for a drink in an hour. (I hate to talk on the phone when you can just get together in person.) And why do I always think it's only going to be  one  drink?  Big Surprise: It ended up being several.  But we ended up having a good time.  He was pretty cool and downright hilarious.  I excused myself at one of the bars we were at (yes, there were several of those too) to go to the ladies'.  While I was in the john, I checked my messages...one came through from Lee Jeans.  'Call me tonight...'  So I called him quick to touch base ('I'll call you tomorrow to chat...I'm out with my friends.') and went back to OG.  'Gee you took a long time in there...what's up?'  'I had to call one of my friends.'  Then later last evening he told me how he really 'felt a connection with me' and he could tell I was feeling it too.  (So now he's psychic?)   I'm way too old for this Three's-Company-type-hijinks.  It's already stressing me out.  Let's just hope I don't run into OG when I'm at the Cubs game with Lee Jeans this Saturday.  Then I'd really have some 'splainin' to do.         "

2559416,female,Student,"              By: TIRI!!!    I was sitting in the police station when someone called and reported a dead body in an apartment in Malibu Street. I was stuck with a lot of work but when I heard the name of the dead person I couldn’t resist taking the case. It was a guy that had been my friend in high school I just needed to know what had happened.  I went to this house, was huge, I entered the room and I saw the body lying out there, I thought how could it be possible that a person could kill somebody that special. I started investigating and picking up evidence, in that moment I saw some papers and the phone miss placed, placed on a table that was beside the bed, they were all disorganized like if he trying to get the phone had disorganized them. I came up to the table and there was a name that caught my attention Jane Warrens, she was a girl that studied with us in high school, there was an address and a phone number. It made me think about why Stewart had this information, so I decided to investigate more deeply. This was because I knew that he had a crush on her since she knew her and the last time I talked to him he still thought about her. So I made my people check his phone bill; his accounts and thinks that could take me to some idea to start looking for a suspect. When I had all the results I noticed that the name Jane Warrens appeared in most of the phone calls he made. I decided to investigate her more deeply. I went to her house and in the moment she saw me she didn’t recognize me, but then when I presented my self she knew who I was. We started talking about how life was going for both of us and in between the chatting I told her about Stewart’s death. She seamed surprised and with the look of her face I started doubting about if she that was so sweet could kill somebody. Then I met her husband, Mathew, a tall and strong man. He was really kind to me and I didn’t waist my opportunity to ask him what he knew about this murder in this moment a saw his reaction, he was really nervous and he didn’t know what to answer. I started to suspect of him but I didn’t tell them anything. First I investigated Mathew’s life and see what he did for a living and how he spent his days for the last 2 months. In between months there was a week where he got out of work and he didn’t leave a message were he could be found, I started suspecting. I started comparing information about the two guys lives and about things that had happened through that time. I noticed something strange, in those two weeks that Mathew had left him office with out leaving a message; his wife had been receiving some messages and some roses from another guy. This made my suspects more accurate. Mathew had been spying on her husband since the first letter arrived and when he discovered that his wife was cheating on him he decided to kill him.  One week went by and now I had all the evidence I needed to take Mathew to the police station to make him some questions. I went to their house and I asked Jane were he was. He wasn’t at home, she told me he was working and asked me what was wrong, I told her about the evidences I found and she freaked out but I couldn’t talk to her I had to get the guy as soon as possible. I went to his office and there he was, talking on the phone so calmed and sure of himself, but when I entered and he looked at me he freaked out and left the phone drop. I told him he had to accompany me to the police station that I had some questions for him. He said that he was mistaken that he had nothing to do with the murder but still I made him come with me.  At the police station I told him what was wrong and why I had called him to ask him some questions. He felt so confused like if he didn’t know what I was talking about it made me doubt, but I still asked him all sort of questions. After a while of talking and asking question he told me the truth, the whole story. We went into my office so he could feel more comfortable, we sat down, and then he started talking.   “Two months ago I was on a business trip, closing a really important deal for the company. I was away for two weeks and a half and when I came back I noticed that my wife was behaving really strange with me. At first I didn’t care I thought that she had a lot of stress on her because around that time she was organizing a family party that was really important. A week went by, the party was over and I still noticed that behavior. I started to suspect that something was wrong, she came late at night saying that she was with her sister or with a friend talking about further parties and events they were planning to do, but that became so often that I started to investigate. One night I went to her mom’s house and I saw that her sister was there, when before in that day she had told me that she was spending the day with her sister. It was strange but I thought that she could be with a friend, or that by that time she was going home and we didn’t cross over in the way. I returned home expecting to see her there but she wasn’t. 30 minutes later she entered and when she saw me in the couch waiting for her she started to act really nervous. I told her where she was and she told me she was with her sister. From there I knew something was wrong the next night I decided to follow her. She drove over to an apartment, I didn’t now from who it was, from all the friends that she had and that I knew no one lived there. I freaked out, but I said to my self not to panic that maybe she had a client for another party. I waited out side until she came out. When she left I decided to go up stairs and see who it was she was with. It was a guy I had never seen before, so I started to suspect that she was cheating on me. I didn’t ask her anything when I got home neither she asked me where I was.”  This made me suspect even more about Mathew and I told him that if from what he was telling me he didn’t think I was going to suspect even more. He told me to listen to him. So I did. “The next day when I went out for the news paper I saw roses beside it. There was a letter saying “To my dearest and beautiful love, Hope you like them and see you soon, love, SK” I picked up the newspaper and the roses I didn’t mentioned anything at breakfast and neither did she. The next three day I followed her and she went always to the same place and every day I asked her where she was and every day she told me she was with somebody arranging things for some parties. The fourth day I followed her until the 5th floor where this guy lived I saw her kiss him as soon as he opened the door from there I suspected what was happening next. I felt betrayed, failed, I felt so bad I didn’t know what to do. I went down; I jumped in my car and drove away without course. The next day she was acting as she did before all sweet and beautiful as the day we got married, but from what I knew I was the one acting strange. I decided I was focusing more on my work and let her drown herself until she had to tell me the truth even though I was furious and wanted to kill the guy. For the following week and a half I dedicated my body and soul to work because there was a mayor problem with the deal I had make like a month before, so I had to go out and make some things to straighten things up and that’s why I didn’t left messages, because we didn’t want no body to know what was going on and it was a really huge deal that maybe the company could loose a lot of money. So we wanted to stay shut. I knew about the murder the day after it was committed and when I saw you come in to out home I was pretty nervous because two day before Stewart was killed Jane went out late at night with the roses that arrived that day, it seemed like if she was trying to free her self from it so I didn’t notice but well I had already notice a long time ago. The day the murder was committed was the last day the roses arrived. That night I went out with some of my colleagues to celebrate the success in closing up the deal and having solved all the problems we had. I was almost mid-night when I went home, when I was parking my car, Jane’s car stationed beside. I suspected that she had gone to see him; I was so furious that I got in my car and told her I had forgotten something at the office that was really important. I got into the car and drove to this guy’s apartment I was really mad, I went to talk to him I knocked on the door but there was no answer. I knocked several times and then decided to through the door down. When I opened the door I found him lying on the floor with blood all over the place, I touched his neck to see if he had a pulse but he was gone. So that was when I called the police and reported the murder, and that’s the whole story” I was shocked on what I just have heard. How could I have been so blind not suspecting of her first. She trying to incriminate her husband saying that he came in late without saying where he was and all sorts of actions that he was supposedly doing but the truth was that she was the one doing them. In that precise moment I stepped out of the office and went for and order to arrest this woman.  We went to her house and told her to come with us she was resisting and saying she had nothing to do with what had happened. But still forced we made her accompany us.  Right back at the police station we placed her in a room to ask her some questions. She didn’t want to answer and we couldn’t obligate her to talk. So I decide to look for another method. I asked Mathew to talk to her and he accepted. He entered the room and as soon she saw him she felt so guilty for making him go through what he had gone that she confessed everything. She murdered Stewart Kent. The roses were all fake, she sent them herself to make it seem like if it was a guy that was obsessed with her, and that she was having an affair. She made this be so obvious to his husband so he noticed that she was having an affair and he went to kill the guy for stilling his wife. In the end she saw that her husband didn’t care so she decided to murder him herself but leaving evidence that seemed as if her husband had killed him. She also said that the affair never happened that the made it up just because she was angry with him because he didn’t close a huge deal for a party from where she could get a great amount of money she could use to pay a debt that she had. We let Mathew out; he had his face red and his eyes full of tears. He was so sad. We told him that everything was going to be o.k now that she had confessed. He asked me what was going to happen to her and I told him that because she had accepted the crime and claimed herself guilty maybe the judge could conceder the penalty. He thanked me about everything. I walked him to the door and shake his had. Again he said thank you  and with his soul in deep pain and tears running down his face I saw him walk away and jump into his car and drive away.          "

4192173,male,Technology,"             With a big sigh of relief, I re-entered the birdcage yesterday to get back to work on HF2. Sadly, the special guest couldn't make it as his mother was making him a going away dinner (note: hes not living here on this side of the planet any more). However, plans have been made to give him loops and such and he WILL appear on this record. And we need him. He's talented, classy and foreign.  So this left Brandt and I to our own devices and the first thing we did was listen to the rough tracks of the inital drum sessions. I'm happy to say the test run was a success and Robinowitz is well on her way. I have some new ideas on how to push her buttons creatively, and we should be implementing those ideas as well. I have referenced recent Gustavo Cerati live show bootlegs as our benchmark for drum/electronic combos.  So B, knowing in advance I was interested in beginning some vox, had the mic and gear set up. It took till 3 am, but I laid down some scratch vox for THE MORNING AFTER THE LIFE BEFORE, SOLAR and what is still called TWO BASSES. This was more to see where my voice is at these days and to see if the melodies and lyrics I had this far for the album worked. Well, Brandt seemed happy with the melodies and lyrics, and hes a fucker when it comes to this stuff, so I think we're at a good point. I'm also happy my voice has gotten stronger with age, or maybe I just know how to use it better. Brandt says I'm hitting 70% of my notes, which for me is a miracle this early in the game.   What will happen now is that I will listen to mp3's of the tracks with vox for a few weeks before cutting the next round of vox. Thats usually when I hit my 95% (the rest is technology at play). But it's off to a good start, and I'm also ready to work out ONENINEFIVESIX and CREATION PHASE as soon as I'm back in the studio.  Happy to report the long awaited REVENGE 2CD set finally arrived yesterday and godDAMN was it worth the wait. I've been living a lie for 12 years as it turns out the entire previously released tracks from their second EP GUN WORLD PORN were all in fact edits and the original versions appear here for the first time ever. Brandt and I almost shit our pants hearing the full version of STATE OF SHOCK (a lost classic). So much of Hook's bass was cut out. Whoever was responsible for that should be killed. Immediately. Anyway, this disc is the best.  I'm enjoying some time at home with Irene and hoping to get into the new Primal Scream bio should I grab a few free moments. Hopefully it's good.  I'm sure we will be discussing Chemlab soon as the album is just starting to get to the kids who pre-ordered. The reactions will be curious.

883178,male,Fashion,"           Kellogg's sent me a quick response.  Thanks, Rosemary:   Thank you for contacting us about your suggestion for Kellogg's(R)Special K(R)Red Berries. While your idea is not new to us, we appreciate your interest and the time you took to submit this idea.  Our company devotes a great deal of time and effort to developing new and improved products, packaging concepts, promotions and merchandising ideas, such as recipe ideas and alternate serving suggestions, to make our products the best on the market.  When this product was first produced Kellogg Company tried different fruit additions.  From the information we have received the name originated because there were more than strawberries added.  Due to consumer review strawberries were chosen as the only fruit to be added.  We are happy that you are enjoying the product.  Again, thank you for contacting us; we appreciate your interest in our company and products.  Rosemary Consumer Affairs Department   On the bottom of Rosemary's very unremarkable retort, there was a push to remember to eat breakfast...   National School Breakfast Week is the perfect time to remind parents of the importance of eating a good breakfast.  Findings from studies conducted by nutrition research organizations continue to support the fact that children who eat breakfast do better academically and behave better in school than those who do not.  The key reason...not eating breakfast means that blood sugar levels remain too low to allow for proper concentration.  Adults can suffer the same problems when they skip breakfast.  So, remember to treat your children...and yourself...to a nutritious breakfast each and every day.  Our cereals and meal-on-the-go products can help!  Go to the Nutrition section of www.kelloggs.com to learn more.   It's looks to me Kellogg's so-called 'studies' are just pushing people to buy more of their product.  My brother always ate breakfast when we were growing up and that never made him 'behave better.'  What a crock.           "
1357293,female,BusinessServices,"            Baptists...Those Dirty Dogs   Ok, so maybe it's the baptists that I hate. After years of growing up under the legalistic dogma that did nothing for me but enhance a sense of shame, I'm realizing that maybe belief systems aren't absolutes, like I had been led to believe. Years of hiding my faults and elevating myself above others as a disguise is coming to an end. And I'm damn glad it is. This screwed up behavior wasn't a conscious effort on my part. It was all that I had known. When things get messed up, you hide it. When you make a mistake, you hide it. When your family embarasses you, you hide it. You don't talk about it. Don't even acknowledge it. This is NOT healthy.   Then you throw in the concept of religion and the stresses accompanying a world view that life demands perfection and so does Jesus. You have people who give you pre-fab answers to life's crappy events and stare at you like you're nuts for not tapping into 'God's peace.' I spent almost my entire life struggling with depression. Whenever I would try to talk to people about it, I would get fucked up answers like 'Whatever is worthy, noble, blah blah blah...think on those things', 'You may be unhappy with the circumstances but if you ask God, He will give you joy even in the  midst of it all' and 'What would our passive Jesus do...turn the other cheek and move on considering it an honor to suffer for Christ.' Ok, so then I pray my whole life and where is this peace....no where. I am angry and hostile on the inside but Jesus doesn't like angry people....so Jesus must not like me then. But what if I just hide the anger and suppress it...maybe He won't notice. Again, these aren't things that I consciously thought about but perspectives I had developed based on the attitudes of those around me.   I don't even want to start on the attitudes of the Baptists as a whole. My time at Seminary was by far some of the worst years of my life dealing with people. As a whole, the Seminary community cared more about proving a theological point to elevate themselves above others than they did about other people. It's so ironic because it should be the one place with the most caring people but it isn't. They sit around and gossip in the name of 'prayer requests', they spread rumors and lies with no regard to the people they are hurting, they are dishonest with the things they struggle with leading them to a lifestyle of hidden sin stuck in a perpetual cycle, they get more upset over petty things like language and immodest clothing than they do about the reason they are even at Seminary....because people are GOING TO HELL. My years spent there were one big lie. It was enveloped in deception. They twist God's word to make themselves look better. This is not what I see as the church when I read the Bible.   Then there's my church that I grew up in...a power hungry pastor elevated above questioning and bent on intimidating those he comes in contact with. A church that says shit to you when you wear jeans to church because everyone knows that Jesus hates those disrespectful jeans. So we must all dress up and act like everything is wonderful so other people at church will think we are super Christians, all the while we are falling apart on the inside. Our families are eroding...dads are fucking younger women, kids are doing drugs, moms are popping pills...then we dress up in our Sunday best and act like everything is wonderful. It's bullshit.   I hate the deception and I hate the lies. I've done it for so long but I'm finished. No more. I'm not going to live my life to make other people view me a certain way. I'm going to be myself. If people like me, then they like me. If they don't, oh fuckin' well because I'm not going to bend over and kiss my ass for every person who won't accept responsibility for their own shit.   I don't know how all of this will play out but I know that things are definitely changing and I kinda like it. I have the right to live a life of freedom and not hold myself under the burdens of this shitty world. So, that's what I'm going to do.         "

1240631,male,Communications-Media,"       Oil prices hit historic highs. The stock market seems to be in a free fall as a the result.  The one biggest fault that I find with the Bush administration is that it is not using this increase in oil prices to push for long term reduction in our use of oil.  Conservation is not simply about having less...it is about structuring our lives so that we get the absolute most from the resources that we consume. In this regard, I think the steady increase in gas prices is actually healthy for the economy since it is focussing people's attention on efficiency. For that matter, one of the first jobs I had was to use information technology to help reduce the fuel consumption of a fleet of trucks. The rising cost of a resource created a need for people to figure out how to get more from the resources consumed.  I also had temp jobs in construction. The firms I worked for were actively eying the cost of materials. When the cost of wood was high, they would employ people to salvage the wood. When it was low, the wood added to the landfills. Pulling nails from lumber is not the best job, but it is worthwhile in that it shows a tendency to maximize the return from invested resources as the price of the resource rose.  I think it is the nature of humans to become destructive when the price of resources is too low.  Anyway, hopefully the rise in the price of fuel is getting people to think about ways to realign their lives and businesses to be less dependent on oil. Is is possible to shorten the commute? Or perhaps it is possible to own two cars: a economy car for every day travel, then the gas guzzling jeep for rare excursions?  Sadly, our fearless leader is not really taking this opportunity to push long term conservation. Oil prices are rising and Bush's circle of oil buddies are getting richer than ever. Bush looks at the economy. His circle of friends is getting richer than ever before. Nothing wrong here!!!!!!!

883178,male,Fashion,"           Here's mine.  Sorry for the length, friends.  BTW - It's absolutely true. ------------------------------------------------------------   Wendy's Consumer Relations Wendy's International, Inc. 4288 W. Dublin-Granville Rd. Dublin, OH 43017  February 28, 2003  Dear Sir/Madam,  Ive always loved Wendys.  From their delicious, juicy hamburgers to their crisp and pleasantly salted French fries all the way down to the creamy and simply dreamy Frosty shakes.  Dave Thomas created a legendary burger shop where quality could be experienced visit after visit.  It was a real treat to enjoy my meals under Wendys roof.  That was, until last Saturday, February 22nd 2003.  My friend and I had the unfortunate pleasure of visiting your Woodbury, Minnesota location sometime around 8:30pm.  We entered the establishment hoping to fill our growling bellies full of deliciousness and stepped up to the counter.  Waiting behind the counter was a scowling young man by the name of Kahled.  As I approached the Can I help you zone, I received nothing of the sort.  Kahled merely glared at me as I smiled and got ready to place my order.  With nary a grunt, he punched in my meal:  - A number five with only ketchup, mustard, pickles, cheese and bacon. - A pack of 5 chicken tenders. - A delicious Mug root beer soft drink. - Regular fries (I decided not to Biggie Size it that night)  Kahled grumbled something that I couldnt understand.  When I asked him: Come again, friend?  He sighed and said rather loudly and abruptly: What do you want on it?  I repeated my request and he scornfully made the necessary corrections.  I felt like I was inconveniencing young Kahled.  As he went to collect the items that made up my order, he engaged himself in a quick kung-fu fight near the bubbling machine where the fries are made.  Another worker, complete in drive-thru gear, launched a kick toward Kahleds nether regions.  The kick was blocked, but with my to go bag in hand.  The paper was crushed and my eyes widened in horror.  This was the bag my food was going to go into?  With no sense of urgency, Kahled collected the rest of my order and dropped them into my mangled sack.  At the soft drink fountain, he began to pour my non-Biggie-sized beverage.  As you probably know, root beer tends to foam a bit more than other soft drinks.  He poured the delicious drink and stopped when the foam got to the top.  Instead of waiting for the bubbles to dissipate, he merely capped it and handed me my order.  He handed me my meal and said nothing.  Not even a Here you go or a Thank you.  He wore the same dejected look throughout the whole transaction.  Even during the kung-fu battle.   When I opened my soft drink, it was as I suspected.  The cup was 3/4s full.  Not the usual value Ive come to expect from Wendys.  My friend received similar treatment and we both decided on the ride home that we had just experienced Wendys at its worst: All because of a young miserable boy by the name of Kahled.  I do enjoy the food Ive received from Wendys in the past.  Im sure, in time, I may be able to forget the awful experience I endured at the hands of Kahled.  Ive always liked what Dave Thomas stood for, but I must say that Mr. Thomas would be absolutely appalled at the treatment we received at the Woodbury Wendys last Saturday night.  Please know that Im going to avoid this location for a long time to come.  I felt I should pass this incident on to you so that the integrity and Daves legacy would not be tainted by someone as awful as Kahled.  I am withholding my home address so that my home isnt attacked by Kahled and his kung-fu squad.  If youd like to reach me to discuss this further, I can be reached at my work number:  555-123-4567.  Fondly, DJ Shovelpants   ------------------------------------------------------------ I had to mail it, sadly.  I don't expect a prompt response.         "
1238294,female,indUnk,"             I'm so obsessed with knitting, I decided I needed a spot where I could track my finished projects, muse about future projects, and generally go on about it all without being a drag on my regular journal, where I get to be boring about my life as a mama instead! I thought I'd just post pictures of my projects thus far, starting with my first scarf last November, which I made along with armwamers, with no pattern for a little family friend; however my son, Silas, is modeling them. They were made with some cheapy Lion Brand chenille, since I was deathly afraid of ruining good yarn, and I had yet to discover the many amazing yarn stores Seattle has to offer!        Next I made a couple facecloths for my sisters for Christmas:    I can't recall what order I made all of these, but I made them in December 03 and January 04. The kids' scarves have no pattern, nor does Vivienne's hat, but Silas' hat is 'Hot Head' from  Stitch 'n Bitch , as is my kerchief:          Next came my  urlLink Booga Bag , my first attempt at felting. I used Noro Kureyon #126:    Around the same time, I started a sweater for Silas. I only JUST finished it, so I'll post pictures as chronologically as I can manage. I also started the 'Little Black Top' from  Stitch 'n Bitch  for my sister, and a felted hat for my other sister. The hat is made with Cascade 220 (black) and a Dalegarn wool (purple), held together with a sparkly bit of something I bought off a cone at my LYS.    Next I decided to make a  urlLink little spring top  for Vivienne. I used Paton's Fresco, and loooved working with a ribbon yarn. It was a nice break from the Little Black Top.    Somewhere in there I made a spring shawl out of Plymouth Eros for our co-op preschool's annual auction, but I can't find any pictures. I did finally finish the 'Little Black (olive!) Top', and it fit my sister perfectly. It was my biggest success to that point. I had a huge sense of accomplishment.   Here is Susan showing it off:    I needed a major break from garments after that, but my addiction forced me to goof around with some spare yarns I had. So, yeah, a beer cozy:    That was pretty dorky, but it  did  inspire a little thing I consider to be pure genius:   (don't pretend you don't eat it out of the pint!)  Then  urlLink WEBS  had a huge sale and I got a steal on some closeout Cascade Lana D'Oro.  I started the 'Under the Hoodie', again from  Stitch 'n Bitch . I'm still working on it, currently working on the first sleeve, but here's a view of the back:    After frogging the sleeve once, I got sick of it and put it away for a few days. Well, of course, I couldn't NOT knit, so I seamed up Silas' sweater at long last:       And that, my friends, brings us up to today! Still plugging away at Under the Hoodie, having made numerous stupid mistakes on the sleeve and having had to frog it twice. Next up is Knitty's  urlLink Cleo  for my other sister, Helen. I'm also planning on a cardigan by Kristin Sperklund from the  urlLink Interweave  free subscriber patterns for Viv, but I have yet to buy yarn or anything. I need to start thinking holidays, too!

589736,male,Technology,"           Two cents:  wrong and evil, and for that matter right and good, are not the same thing.  Also:  of the final examples, I feel rape is the stronger of the two.  Murder is a sub-category of ending a life, and requires more clarification to be both relevant and effective.  A minor distinction, but an important one for your larger argument.  As to the issue of suffering needlessly, I am generally curious:  at what point does the suffering become needless?  For that matter, when is suffering needful?  Is suffering validated by the beauty or wisdom that comes from it?  If one person suffers from a disease and draws on that suffering to compose a heartrending symphony and then dies, while another without such talent stares out a dirty window until he or she suffers the same fate, unknown and unheard -- were both experiences equally needless?  What of the many who will be touched by and grow from hearing the symphony?  For that matter, what of the son or daughter of the other individual, who, having watched the loved one die, dedicates him- or herself to raising a stronger and more loved family than might have been possible before?  Does that person's suffering suddenly become needful?  I raise such questions not because I favor generally institutionalized suffering -- surely not -- but I am reluctant to dispense with suffering altogether by labeling it as needless, without understanding where the line is drawn, beyond the usual extreme examples.  I feel that only by defining one's terms can one be assured of success in any discourse.  Once again, my issue is with absolutes.  I am wary of them.  They occur nowhere in the universe except the human imagination, and I have yet personally to see one single absolute that applies in infinite cases at infinite times.         "

They run around with high-pitched voices learning to share the toys they have brought, to the beach, to a family vacation.    Little girl cousins are a special thing.  They are automatic playmates and best friends.  They share genes and are beginning to share their lives, their growing up.  They clamor to the beach with all their might, they play in the sand for hours, filling buckets, dragging water from the surf, and hunting for shells.  They are adorable in their bathing suits and their skin tans easily even through super strength sun block.  Their fathers or mothers take them into the water and hold them safely from the waves.  The tidal pools are a perfect depth.  Rafts are their best toys, but sometimes it is just their hands and the sand and saltwater.  They get dirtier than they have ever been and never seem to notice the grittiness, the stickiness.  They don’t want to go into the house even after hours of playing, but they love to rinse off with the hose, a semi grown up shower for a little girl.    Watching your nieces you relive your cousin time at the beach, at Salter Path Family campground, on the Bogue Sound.  Your playground was the sound and your favorite things were floating on a raft on the calm water and clam digging.  You and your cousins where obsessed with shells.  You hunted them tirelessly throughout the days on the beach or at the inlet at the north end of the island.  At the end of the shell hunts, you surveyed your treasurer.  You memorized the shapes and names, the olives and whale eyes and baby cradles and cigarettes.  It is years later that you realize, browsing through shell books that some names were made up by your mothers, sisters.  The next morning, you woke up early to set up shop.  You took boxes your mothers had packed in, turned them upside down, and laid old towels on top.  You set out your shells by the side of the road in the campground.  You sold seashells by the sound.  You were thrilled with every purchase.  After a few days of selling, you and your cousins and mothers would walk the path of the campground to the real shell shop near the main road.  You were amazed with the polished shells.  You bought cleaned sand dollars and gold-rimmed hermit crab shells and rope bracelets.    Your cousin still loves shells and houses them in glass jars in her home.  You don’t need them around you anymore, but when you see shells or revisit the beach or see little girl cousins playing, you wish for the days at Salter Path, for the shelling and sound.  You wish for you cousins and you hope the new cousins will long for their beach days and each other when they are older.           "
3059476,female,indUnk,"       Well, its been over a week, and I remember very little of the details. To be in the presents of one who can see you have something on your mind, and being unable to bullshit your way out of the 'What are you thinking?' inquisition is exceedingly difficult. He is the cause of my heavyheartedness, yet, the one who could relieve me...By saying what I want to hear. Which is exactly what my problem seems to be...There must be someone who would tell me exactly what I want(possibly need) to hear...Yet, it would be meaningless coming from any other...He has, easily, addled me more than any other could even attempt...This problem stemmed directly from our very eerie likeness, from a physcological standpoint. He has been the only one to ever 'figure me out' and I, him. As a result, no games, no facades, no bafflement with bullshit. Its truly hard to be totally honest.          "

2844168,female,Marketing,"                  The adventures of Tropical Sister Chicks and da brother   Well, well. Where do I begin? What an awesome weekend!  Friday -  A Spa Treatment, A Writing Victory & Concert #1  Karon and I dropped Ked off at work on Friday and headed back to Fort DeSoto for another day at the beach. As we were walking toward the beach an older gentleman wearing a ballcap sitting at a picnic table waved at us. I did a double take as I realized a squirrel was sitting on his head eating the corn the gentleman was setting on the bill of his hat! It turned out to be a very windy day and Karon decided it would be fun to ride the waves. The water was so cold it felt like a tub full of ice! The waves made it hard to find many sand dollars. We found a couple then headed back to our towels. The wind was blowing the sand and it wasn't long before we were covered head to toe in a thin layer of sand. All we needed to do was scrub in some water and we had a full body spa exfoliating treatment! Karon managed to eat all of her sandwich too. There were a couple birds hovering over us while we ate, but I kept flailing my arms and yelling at them calling them all sorts of names. Finally they flew away and I was sure I heard one of them squawk 'stupid tourists!' We didn't stay at the beach long and headed back to the apartment and jumped in the pool to get rid of that gritty feeling.  That afternoon I was under pressure to finish a project for Ked. He needed content for a website he is doing for his Uncle Ben. Ben was diagnosed with a brain tumor several years ago. If you haven't been reading Ked's blog, check out his entry for  urlLink February 17 , he sums this project up well. It's been a tough one for us to work on because it is so personal and painful. Ked had asked me to work up some text for the site and I wrestled with it for weeks. Friday was the deadline and I knew Ked wanted it Saturday morning. I took a shower after Karon and I went swimming and I was praying asking God for help. I had no idea what to say or how to present Ben's story. Suddenly, the words just started flowing. I jumped out of the shower, dressed and headed straight to my computer. Fifteen minutes later what I had been wrestling with for several weeks was on the screen. I was so thankful and knew that God had helped me. As I relayed the story to Ked over dinner he said, 'Now you're starting to sound like a professional writer. You just had your first story come to you in the shower!' Keep your eyes on  urlLink www.bencarrfamily.com . The site should be up in the next week. Ben and his family are very dear to us, and they could use your prayers.  Friday night ended with Ked and I going to the Linkin Park P.O.D. concert. We had a great time and came home with raspy voices. Karon insisted that she did not want to go and spent the evening at our place with Sadie and some good movies.   Saturday - Concert #2  Saturday we spent the morning tying up some responsibilities around the house. Karon and I headed to JoAnn's etc. to fuel our obsession of scrapbooking. They were having a BIG sale and Karon found some great stickers for all the pictures she's taken while down here.  We headed over to Winter Haven to pick up Kristen for the  urlLink See Spot Rock  concert in Orlando. We had a couple hours to hang out with the family and Karon, Ked, Kristen, Uncle Dan, Molly and I played a short round of RISK. None of us really knew what we were doing at first, but it was a lot of fun! Paul and Molly begged us to come back next week and play again, but they said we can't come until next Saturday. They're grounded from RISK until then. Apparently after we left for the concert a nuclear explosion happened and game pieces were all over the house in a Paul/Molly explosion!  We had an absolute BLAST at the concert at the Last Wave Club. The club is a ministry that was started as a safe and fun place for teens to hang out in the Orlando area and as an alternative to the secular club scene. Before heading in, we three girls used some of Karon's red hair paste gave ourselves some red streaks and glittered our faces. Ked had these glow sticks and we each put one in our mouths and it was so cool because the club was dark and we were glowing. People kept asking us if it was our gum and where we had gotten them. After a while though they started to taste funny and we realized they were leaking! So we threw them out. But Ked's actually exploded in his mouth and it was really funny because his mouth was all speckled and glowing!! The club was packed and it wasn't long before it was hot and sweaty. Our favorites of the evening were  urlLink GRITS , Pillar, and Skillet. Karon and I had seen Skillet in concert last year and WOW have they changed up their sound! Their new album is incredible and they sound so much bigger and better! We didn't care as much for 12 Stones. The other three bands were purposeful in their testimony and music without being preachy. 12 Stones had a lead singer who was sometimes just plain strange and there wasn't much point really to their performance other than to just sing. During the show there was a group of Jr. High boys that had way too much testosterone and they decided to mosh. We got quite the kick out of watching Ked throw elbows every time they came too close to 'his girls'! Afterwards we got to meet and have our pictures taken with GRITS, Skillet and Pillar. All those guys and gals were just so awesome. They were friendly and personable and I  just can't describe how cool they were. It was an awesome evening and once again we had scratchy voices!! We headed back to the Carrs place and got a few hours sleep before getting up and heading to Sea World!!   Sunday - dolphins, Sting Rays, and Whales, Oh my!  Sunday we headed to Sea World Orlando. It had been at least 20 years since I had been to a Sea World and over 10 since Karon and Ked had been. We had such a great time! The weather was beautiful, but we still decided to avoid the splash zones at the shows. We loved seeing the dolphins and killer whales show off their skills and interact with the trainers. What a rush that has to be for them to be launched in the air by a killer whale! We got to pet some dolphins and sting rays and get a peek at some adorable baby dolphins. The sea otter show was hilarious! Those animals are so much fun! And we also enjoyed the Pets Ahoy show where they train various animals from a rat to cats, dogs, geese, and a pig that they rescue from shelters. I would love to know how they trained those cats. We can't get Sadie to do anything! We left the park not long before they closed and headed over towards Downtown Disney. We had some great Chicago style pizza at Pizzeria Uno and then walked the shops at Downtown Disney. That place was CRAZY shoulder to shoulder people! Spring Break is definitely in session! Karon and I hit, can you believe it, the scrapbook shop!! She picked up some cute Mickey shaped eyelets and some Disney stickers. We then walked through a couple more shops where you can find just about anything with a Disney label and theme that you could ever imagine. Finally we headed to our hotel with aching feet and burning eyes. We caught a few hours sleep before getting up early and heading to meet Uncle Dan at Disney World on Monday!   Monday - Lions, Tigers and Winne the Pooh, Oh my!  We met Uncle Dan at the entrance to the Animal Kingdom bright and early at 8 a.m. sharp! He let us in the gate and suggested that we go on the safari first thing. He walked us back and rode the safari with us. Uncle Dan is hilarious and we love hearing him tell us the inside stuff at Disney. We'd be riding along and the safari guy driving the bus would excitedly shout 'look at those ostrich eggs!' We'd look and Dan would smirk. I'd ask 'hmm...I bet those eggs have taken three years to hatch!' Disney is quite amazing at putting together an experience. Yes, the animals are live, but those termite hills that are as hard as concrete that the animals scratch their heads on really are as hard as concrete because...um, they are concrete!! After the safari Dan said adios and we headed out exploring more of the Kingdom. We did all we could do in Animal Kingdom then headed to MGM for screams and thrills on the Tower of Terror and Rock'n RollerCoaster. I love those 2 rides. Tower of Terror is my favorite because they have like 12 variations so it's different every time. It's just so cool to not know when you're going to drop or how many times. I'm not sure what's more thrilling -- the suspense of when you're going to drop or the actual drop!! Then we headed to the madness of the Magic Kingdom and finished out the day there. We decided not to stay for the fireworks and left a little early to save $20 and catch dinner outside the park. Our feet were aching and our eyes burning, but we were exhausted and happy. What a fun weekend! It was a blast to share all that fun with Karon. She's so cool and a riot to hang out with. Sometimes we get to laughing until we cry. It's so cool because we're all friends and we've been friends for so long and have shared so many memories. I guess that's the cool thing about knowing your husband's family for sooo long. I feel like I've been part of the family forever (I mean we're going on 10 years of being together). Thanks!!  So, Friday was Kurt and Ken's birthdays. We tried to send out a Happy Birthday Yo, but we didn't catch either of them. I guess the siblings don't matter as much now that they have the ladies. =) We left messages to let them know we were thinking of them. Then the Mama's birthday was Saturday, and we did catch her to send a Happy Birthday song. Hope you all had great birthdays! We were thinking of you as we sung our lungs out at our concerts.  Well, I'm sure I missed some of the details, but you're probably tired of reading by now, and I really need to go to bed. Karon and I have one last day of fun planned before she heads back!! Maybe I'll post a picture tomorrow, but for now Ked posted one at   urlLink www.onpointmediagroup.com/blog . Tropical Sister out!               "

The trees, The sky, Even the very air I breathe -  It all seems so surreal,  As if they were masks created to convince my mind That knowledge is found through sight, That love is found through giving. I yearn to see beyond what is here, Not with my eyes Rather with my very being. There is something more. Something so unexplainable and uncomprehendable. Something that most people shall never see. Nor will they miss not seeing it, For they view the world only with their eyes. To open oneself up to the true source of vision is far too terrifying. Not because of what is seen, but rather for us to truly see,  We must become transparent, Totally exposing ourselves to this harsh world. Yet even more terrifying, we must view ourselves as we truly are. So, we convince ourselves that happiness is found solely  In our state of blindness. A lie that swallows our desire to see.   **This was written on 8-5-99 when I was struggling through depression and God's role in it all. It is so awesome to see what God has brought me out of!!

4192173,male,Technology,"             While the asses cobraed yesterday, it was back to the Birdcage (the new name for the studio) to work on the Audio Warfare remix. As I'm sure you can figure out, the track is pretty hard, and quite honestly, the remix is even harder. I think my friend Christian Nitrate will approve.   Needleye delivered big time on their remix of the aggression's MY WHITE NOVA. It's a stormer and does what I like best with remixes, uses a lot of the original song for the listener to know its a remix, yet adds so much of themselves to it that it becomes interesting and original. They manipulated a vocal that original said 'you were so goddamn pretty' to sound like 'you were so goddamn prissy'. Hilarious. Kudos and thanks to Gilez and Needleguys. The remix reminded me of why I originally wanted to be in a heavy band.   However, now with half the EP now, I find myself in that position that I HATE more than anything, which is nagging the other remixers to hand theirs in by the deadline. This is even harder when you have people remixing in places like Japan and Russia. When I was watching over 12 or so remixers for PURE LIQUID EGO, I felt like the bigggest asshole in the world trying to get people to finish, especially since they were working for free. Hate it. I do like nagging Jamie Duffy though...he deserves it. ;-)  It's interesting that while I am chin deep in the Hypefactor album, I find myself going back to listening to very hard music. I'm loading the Ipod with old v23, Schwein and of course, old Chemlab. I think this is a yin and thing. Ash was recently disenchanted with one of his many musical projects and I explained to him that we all have different moods and the music we do reflects that. That's why now, in our Power Station/Arcadia phase, I feel a longing for the aggression and that kind of music. Eventually. Right now, I have Chemlab to keep me in that vibe.

936098,male,Student,"       After we watched Vegas Vacation and left Sara's dad's house, we realised we had a lot of time, so we went to the beach and looked at the stars for a little while. We could only see half the stars because of clouds, and lightning was increasingly rampant. RAMPANT. There was a cop driving by, and then he stopped and turned around, so we thought he was going to steal our fireworks but he didn't. My hero.   Little did we know . . .   a few minutes after that we were wishing he had stopped us, because it started raining out of nowhere. And it wasn't pansy rain, it was Brazoria County rain, meaning raindrops the size of basketballs. We couldn't see a thing past the water. It was nearly impossible to know if we were headed out to the ocean or about to slam into a dune--the only thing we could see well enough to use as a point of reference was a trashcan, until another car appeared. We asked them how long until another access road, and they told us a couple of miles. The water was rising, and we were in it. Sara's car was repelling the basketballs pretty well, but her tires needed a miracle to . . . not . . . get stuck in the sandy mud. I thought we were going to be washed out to the ocean; the water was probably six inches deep at least in some parts, and it happened pretty instantly. We were trying to find an access road but it was impossible to tell if we were passing them because the rain was so intense. (If we had been on any other road we would have had to stop and pull over to wait out the intensity of the rain, but obviously this was the worst of our options at this point.) I decided we should pray, so we held hands and I prayed out loud that God would make us safe.  Less than ten seconds later , we saw the headlights of a truck on the access road, turned in, and followed the Bluewater Highway towards home.    "
4192173,male,Technology,"             Greetings from LA. I hear y'all might have some snow there...just a rumour I've heard while driving around in my convertible.  Not much to report other than I'm working non-stop, but I am happy to say I just got back from seeing THE LAST SAMURAI at Mann's Chinese Theatre (THE best place to see movies here, arclight be damned), and godDAMN was this movie incredible. I don't think it's any secret that I have a love of the Asian culture, and I felt this movie successfully told a great story and respected the world and culture of the Japanese quite well. Cruise was phenomenal as well, mad intense. This is rivalling LOST IN TRANSLATION as my movie of the year (only cause I have yet to see THE BROWN BUNNY). Anyhow, I strongly urge you to see this film. Quite moving stuff.  On music note, has anyone heard the new Die Warzau track, RADIATION BABIES? What a smoking return from one of the all time greats. Keep your ears open for this one.  Irene tells me the new Connelly album is waiting in my mail at home, as if wanting to get home to her wasnt enough, now theres an awesome new CD waiting there. ugh.  And yes, im working on music in the free moments. Listening to the demos and writing words and such. I'd like to think my colleagues have figured out when they are recording drums, but for some reason I doubt it...  And now for some long awaited sleep. Be well all.  F         "

4192173,male,Technology,"             Just back from the Harry Potter premiere here in NYC. Good movie, solid direction and an extremely hilarious cameo by ex Stone Rose Ian Brown (a pal of the director's, hence the cameo). Of course in all of Radio City Music Hall only two people went mad for Ian Brown: myself and Dan Hamill (though you should have seen Mr. G pop for Emma Watson when they came out to introduce the movie, not that I blame him). As for the movie, it lacks one thing, which is a major bad guy. Let's just say Kenneth Branagh got more screentime in the last movie than Oldman does in this. Special thanks to Mattagement for hooking Irene, G and myself with tix. The post show dinner at the original hardcore Benihana was most enjoyable and as always, the company (G, Matt and Jax) is always first rate.  Stepping back to my industrial roots, I've heard the new WATTS album for the first time today. It's always fun to hear something new from Raymond, and this is no exception. With WATTS, Raymond tries some new things, going into more electronic territory while also stripping down his usually thick sound. It was a smart decision not to call this a PIG album, because with the way its produced and performed, its not. When it does sound like Pig, its more of a reference than anything. I know some of you die-hards are pissed, but quite honestly, he's smart not to fuck with the PIG brand name. I know that sounds kinda corporate, but when he goes back to doing something as PIG, no one can fuck with him when he wanted to try something different here. Having spent years tracking down almost everything the man has ever recorded, I'm a sucker for most things Watts, so I might be a bit biased.  I am told in their first outing, MOG Athletics won ONE game and lost FIVE in dodgeball. I would like to congratulate these beatiful losers on a job well done!!  F          "

I never knew any muslim kids, or taiwanese/chinese kids, or catholic kids or even african-american kids.  i grew up in the new era of bussing and desegregation but there was very little socializing done among the different races.  the closest i ever got to diversity was my italian/american cousins and even they lived very far away.  its encouraging for me to see my children playing with other children just because they have fun together.  and sometimes i get to share a little knowledge and teach a little tolerance.  last night, my oldest diva overheard someone talking religion by the pool.  he was talking about jesus to some muslim kids, and my daughter said, 'Muslims don't believe in god.'  I briefly explained the small differences between the two religions.  that little optimist in me can't help but believe that if i can teach my children they may teach their children.  eventually, we will all understand that we are all one.  ok.  gotta get some work done.  diva out.

The movie touches on the physical and spiritual dilemma of facing the unknown and overcoming one's fear in order to emerge 'reborn on the other side'.

589736,male,Technology,"           John --  Given that if I die her options in life greatly diminish -- and given that others with similar conditions do not have access to the benefits that I can provide, albeit with difficulty -- I will opt for affordable.  That said, I don't consider the two goals (affordability and high quality) necessarily to be mutually exclusive -- but that, as with most things, is a matter of individual conclusions drawn from the available data.  And yes, I do indeed subscribe to a number of absolutes -- while accepting that acting on those absolutes is not entirely effective in all cases, despite the times when I do anyway.  They're also subject not only to change, but to wide variation based on past and future conditions.  I try to adapt and accept that any given conclusion I form may be wrong, but I don't often succeed.  The curse of consciousness:  the only universe I will ever truly know is the one I perceive, physically, mentally, emotionally, or spiritually.  If anything is a recipe for godhood, that's it.  Fraught with unseen dangers, human consciousness is.  That said, I wish there was a Republican I could vote for.  But conservative ideology has replaced judgment; guiding principles have become a careening, unthinking thrillride.  I'd say the same of a Democrat if such was the case; but so far, Kerry has not alarmed me.  Perhaps he will.  To be fair, very likely he will.  We left the altruistic politician (of any ideology) far behind some 200+ years ago (if he or she ever existed at all).  Until either party stops trying to stir its base into a frothy frenzy, the only option available to me is to do my part to keep the pendulum from swinging too far either way.  This administration has swung it too far, too fast.  Any party could have done it.  The pendulum's arc needs to be tempered.  Lacking a leader I can trust, I will opt for tempering until something better comes along.         "

You assume that we were in the area of the museum(s) when they were looted.  Keep in mind that we still have not fully secured Baghdad last I knew.  But, assuming that we were standing right in front of the museum as looting was going on, how should we have stopped hundreds of people from looting/stealing/destroying these artifacts?  Shoot them?  Beat them with the butts of rifles?  The US Army and Marines are not into crowd control.  They are not permitted to operate in a police capacity in the US (posse comitatus).  They don't carry a lot of tear gas, especially when in a war zone.  Their primary job is to identify the enemy, not looter, and shoot him.

Once the peps and shrimps look happy (bam!) add some green bellpepper and some vegetable ( those with lots of leaves types of vegetable), after chopping them into bite sizes.  Beat two eggs together and put into the pep, shrimp, bellpepper and vegetable mix. Add some more seasoning if you like. If you have limes, squeeze half of the lime to get the juice right on top of the sauteeing stuffs, just to give a bit of a kick!  Look around in your fridge, if you have some cheese (laughing cow cheese is the best) throw some of them into the pan just before you turn the heat off so they melt beautifully.  In another pan, steam some baby carrot. (have this thing steaming at the beginning of the step)  To serve, get a bowl, put some of the steamed baby carrot (without the steaming water),&nbsp;amount undecided, and on top of them put the sauteed pep, shrimp, bellpepper, vegetable and egg from&nbsp;the other pan.  Optional: For crispiness, if you have any tortilla&nbsp;somewhere&nbsp;in your fridge, broil them in the oven at 400 F for about 5 minutes or until they're really crispy. Do this sometimes before you finish sauteeing the meats and vegetable.

I saw the play(s) when it (they) was (were) in Minneapolis several years ago.  This version was on HBO, and I watched it on a video tape that my in-laws lent me.  It is six hours long, so I would encourage you to take it in installments.  Still, this play (these plays), this movie (these movies)are art.  Kushner won a Pulitzer for the plays, and you can see why:  they are art, pure art.  The conversations about religion, sexuality, race, patriotism, sickness, convalescence, history, politics, conservatism, liberalism, addiction, parenthood, marriage, divorce (togetherness, separation), mortality, immortality, gain and loss, freedom and slavery are simply amazing.  There are moments when it becomes a bit too arty and perhaps too literary (if thats possible), but it succeeds on so many levels that you are left slack-jawed and amazed.  As I watched it, I kept thinking I cant believe one person wrote this.  The writing is so rich (maybe too rich sometimes) that you imagine some of the ideas were a lifetime in the making.  The acting:  Emma Thompson is great.  Al Pacino is magnificenthas Meryl Streep ever done a poor acting job?  Ive never seen it.  But the show was stolen (stop, thief!) by Jeffrey Wright (Basquiat) who has to be among our nations best actors.   Art lovers, see this film!

From darkhorizons:  '...the official site reports that Anakin apparently has a scar in the movie but he does not get it in the film, rather the event happens in one of the books preceeding the film.'  Okay, so now *another* book is canon?  What the hell?  Is this a movie or not?  Is it a movie about people whose further adventures are recorded by unnamed historians, or novels about people who occasionally get filmed by some omniscient documentarian?  If both the movie and the book are essentially the same thing, is the movie a better story because it was the one that got filmed, or rather does the book supply backstory that the movie couldn't manage, and if so, why not?  I understand this is just a marketing ploy, but it raises profound questions about the nature of narrative.  (Please note that I'm focusing on canonical texts that occur in the same world and timeline as a movie, or vice versa, *not* spin-offs of either medium that provide alternate adventures.)         "

Vicky and I headed to Kristen's house in the Bronx for a bbq. She lived far out but it didn't matter b/c we spent the night and it was worth it. Vicky and I ate a lot of chicken and hot dogs. But we  killed  the donuts. It was great but very  fullfilling , lol. Then soon as the hours went by we all went outside. Kristen's neighbors were lighting up fireworks in the middle of the street. It was cool and pretty at first but then it started to swift it's position. It went in the air but then as it went down it looked like it was going to hit us. I screamed my ass off and ran around the corner. There were many coming one after another. I think they did that on purpose just to enjoy our screaming of being terrorized. Kristen was just having a blast laughing at us. She was just standing there like it was no tomorrow. Hmm...let her ass get burned, lol, I'll be down the block. Later that night we had a ritual. A burning ritual. Lol. Vicky and Kristen were burning everything from plastic cups to pop rocks. Haha. It was great. I think Kristen has a slight fetish for hot wax. She kept pouring it on her from the candles outside. I was like what is wrong with you?? Do you know how hot that is? She was like it really doesn't burn. It feels so good. You should try it. -Pours-. *Lets out ahh.* :-/. I really worry about her. Then I was feeling a little darish and told them to flash the air. They only showed thier bras. Pussies I said. They were like well u haven't done anything yet, let me see you do it. So I did. I flashed the air with my feminine parts formely known as breast. =D. Then after burning half of the cups and ruining the poor cement we headed inside for the night. I was the 1st to take a shower. Then as soon as I get out Kris and Vicky both come in the bathroom and go in the shower...together...with thier clothes on. I'm like what in the world. They're like Sharice come in with us. It's gonna be fun so I get in, only I'm already washed and half a little towel on me. It was getting soaked so you know what I said fuck it and took it off. I was completely naked. It was great. Then they started washing thier hair. Vicky washed Kristen's and I washed Vicky's. Ahh those are the hightlights of the night. I had fun. It was the best 4th of July I ever had...yet. I'm out. Peace.    You are the Moon card. Entering the Moon we enter the intuitive and psychic realms. This is the stuff dreams are made on. And like dreams the imagery we find here may inspire us or torment us. Understanding the moon requires looking within. Our own bodily rhythms are echoed in this luminary that circles the earth every month and reflects the sun in its progress. Listening to those rhythms may produce visions and lead you towards insight. The Moon is a force that has legends attached to it. It carries with it both romance and insanity. Moonlight reveals itself as an illusion and it is only those willing to work with the force of dreams that are able to withstand this reflective light.

4187211,female,Student,"             People who can hack being in the front row of a concert shouldn't be there in the first place! Ah Matthew Good, a great show, a great band, a great location, and a stupid audience - what else is new. This is not to say that I didn't throughly enjoy both the opening act, Wil, and Matt Good, they were amazing - especially from our hard won front row spots, but why do people think that shoving as hard as they can the people in front and to the side of them is going to make anyone's experience any better? I seriously had to elbow this guy a few times because he kept pushing up against me, and believe me, I wasn't planning on moving anywhere - we were about as close as you could get without being on stage. I understand that with a rock crowd in a bar, there's expected to be a little pushing and such, but three people body surfing in a not so large venue, come on now that's just a little ridiculous. I think that the aggressive side of me comes out when placed in those sorts of situations, I was just as ready to shove back, and I don't think that me and Tara moved more than a couple of inches the whole night. I certaintly wouldn't want to be a security person at one of those things! When it started getting rowdy, the girl next to me started freaking out a little, and I thought she was going to throw up, so we had to let her out - the security guys were pretty good at making sure the smaller people were doing okay (not that they asked us - we must have looked pretty determined). But I'm ranting. The music was great, he played mostly from his new album and a couple well chosen older songs like 'Picture Yourself' (forgive me if I have the title wrong...). And at the end me and Tara managed to pick up one of the set lists and a drumstick (yes, it's a little obsessive, but fun nonetheless) which we got signed by the man himself! Tara was tempted to stalk him back to his hotel, but we decided that would be way too creepy as the streets were fairly deserted and he was walking with two body/security guards... I swear that we're not that obsessed (disclaimer - I was mostly following Tara... really...). One girl asked to have Matt's half finished glass of beer and she got it! ewww, what would you do with that? What ever tickles your fancy I guess (well, not like I can do much with a drumstick, but at least it's keepable). Anyway, if you're a Matthew Good fan, I highly recommend you see him live, but just be prepared to stand your ground if your in the throng.          "

'I Will Follow' was played on both tours (from their original album) as was 'the hits' from 'War', 'The Unforgettable Fire', and 'The Joshua Tree'.  I think you're thinking of the drastic overall difference between their concerts of the '80s and their concerts of the '90s.  Popmart/Zoo TV, etc were flashy, multi-media spectacles (and great f--king shows) that were a big contrast from the simple '4 guys on stage' concerts that they did in the '80s.  Plus, they were playing stadiums vs. theaters.  Lots of people balked, and U2 was like 'deal with it'.  But they always had a diverse set list.  Anyway... just go to a show when they are in town again.  You'll thank me for it.  Though I'm not sure if Larry will take of his shirt again.  That was just special.         "

4157968,male,Student,"        That's it, after four days without going on a John Kerry rant, I think it's about time to put shoty back in his place. While visiting Grand Canyon with his wife John Kerry (in typical fashion) vowed to devote more money to our Fledgling Fedeeral Park system. This idea, was met with wide applause (naturally, seing as the audience were national park goers) but I question the meaning behind this promise. In typical election year fashion, Kerry once again makes an empty promise that stirs up a fervor amoung potential voters. In trademark style (might as well give Kerry a flashy logo and stamp it on anything he says or does) Kerry makes an appealing promise, without any thought or true agenda behind it. Kerry fails to realise, or perhaps fails to adress, the lofty financial responsibilities needed to validate such a promise, and instead favors empty promises and purple hearts. Americans need to wake up and realise that a man who voes against increasing funding for our troops in Iraq, and yet in his acceptance speech promises to send in 40,000 more troops (while also pledging that he has an exit plan, though never actually telling the public what that it), can never be a fiscally responsible president. Kerry assails Bush for his record defecits, and he's right, in the past Bush has'nt been fiscally responsible in any sense of the word. However, Kerry's economics do nothig to substntiate his claims that he is a more fiscally responsible president. While Kerry promises to 'cut the federal defecit in half, quicker (another vague-Kerry-staple word) then the Republicans!' He plans to do so while raising exspenses in several areas, and cutting taxes in the middle class. True he does plan to roll back tax cuts in the upper class, but with the far greatr number of americans who would benefit from middle-class tax cuts, versus the number of americans who would be adversly affected by repealing Bush's tax cuts; I question whether little to any new revenues would be gained from this endeaveur. Kerry promises a brighter future, but what he really wants is a brighter-coloured house...      "

My dad's just got back from ASDA and no, he doesn't live there! He was doing 'the weekly shopping', it has taken him about two hours though but there you are.   My parents have decided to go to Yorkshire or somewhere next week. I don't think they realise that if we're getting rain here then it must be pretty bad up there. They want to go walking, up a hill.

Ya'll should know that I'm a dreamer and always wish to be that person who recieves a dozen roses from a guy, that would be the sweetest thing, but I haven't. One year I was sick on vday and others I just see all my friends getting all these gifts or valentines and then I don't. I have gotten more valentines this year though, thanks to Echo! haha, but hmmm nothing much different yet..... It is only like 1:30 in the afternoon right now on vday, so I do have the rest of the day.... we'll see. All I know is that I feel pretty good today and that my horoscope wasn't too bad either. It said:  Romance is the least logical science, if you can even call it one. You'll end up with a person you really want, regardless of any self-delusion. Yesterday's bad luck leads you to today's gold mine. I don' think a horoscope can get much better than that, lets just hope that it actually holds true. It did get one part right already though... yesterday's bad luck, maybe it was just saying that because it was friday the 13th, but I really didn't have good luck yesterday either.   Everything in school was hot and went pretty well, the only bad thing about yesterday during school was that I my stomach didn't feel very good, but it wasn't anything bad. I had my quarterfinal section game yesterday though and so many of my friends came and I was soooo excitied and I just wanted to play my ass off, and I did for the first period.... but then I got like sick, I don't know what's wrong with me, but ya I felt like I was going to just pass out like hard core, not the best feeling to have when you want to play 100% and when you want to help the team out as much as you can. So ya I guess you can say my bad luck yesteday was that because you dont' even know how bad I wanted to play and how shitty it felt when I couldn't. But anyways we won thankfully, first time in park girls history to get past the 2nd round. We now play Thursday at 8:15 at parade, everyone better be there. But ya all I know is that if that was our last game and if that was how I ended my last game I woudl have cryed so hard, we almost lost too, we were losing like the whole game and whenever we'd score to make it so that we were only down by one they'd score again, but some how we tied it up in the last like 5 min and went into overtime and won 6-5. All I was thinking the whole game when I like couldn't play was that we better fucking win, and we did, whoa. All I have to do now is make sure I can play next game and don't die and figure out why the fuck I'm tierd all the time!   Anyways I'm excited for tonight, maybe I will get my prince charming.

He&nbsp;is a big lump of goo when it comes to infants of any species (except possibly worms, and insects; I dunno, larvae don't have much opportunity for cuteness).&nbsp; He seriously melted at Zed's kitty cat, and my sister's baby boy, Nicky gets so much coodling when Kevin is around.&nbsp; Watch out Laura!&nbsp; if you marry Kevin, you shall have no choice but to bear&nbsp;him his super offspring!&nbsp; lol!&nbsp; and I wouldn't worry, either.&nbsp; as doting as Kevin is, you wouldn't have to pay any attention to the kid at all, cause Kevin would be doing it all!!! ahh, I can hear Laura grinding her teeth, and tearing her hair at this very moment.&nbsp; *sigh* yeah, I'm a bit in a teasing mood today.&nbsp; I have had two cups of coffee, a small glass of really nasty sherry that Mom's friend Ken gave me (watered down with 7up, cause it was really REALLY nasty sherry; I don't even like sherry, why'd he even bother wasting it on me???), and I am clad mostly in underwear.&nbsp; Life is good. Ahrodie just got spayed, so no more puppies for her, and her haltie was forgotten at the vet's office, so we have to go back and get it, or no more walks for her, either.&nbsp; She'd never forgive me!&nbsp; I can't wait to get those kitties!&nbsp; I seriously don't even care what my mom says, I must have two more.&nbsp; Admittedly, it's alittle unfair to Moth, cause she deserves to live out the rest of her life without feline competition for attention, but she's only twelve.&nbsp; She could live for another eight years possibly.&nbsp; And I don't wanna wait until I'm twenty-four to get another kitty.&nbsp; I wanna get a girl and a boy, and name them Sebastian, and Charlotte.&nbsp; And I'll even keep the litter box in my closet, and do all the cleaning it out, and they can sleep in my bed, and I'll buy them kitty toys, and kitty treats, and play with them, and I'll love them tons and tons and tons!&nbsp; I REALLY want a kitty! And you know, when I say that I'll take care of them, I actually mean it.&nbsp; And I think I proved that with Ahrodie.&nbsp; A puppy is a bigger responsiblity that a kitty, and I took good care of Ahrodie.&nbsp; I seriously took her out to poop and pee outside four times a night!&nbsp; Once at eleven, once at midnight, once at one, and once at four or five.&nbsp; It was really hard, but I actually remember it as a good experience.&nbsp; Which makes me really enthusiastic about having a kitty, or two. Anyway...I'll just stop now.&nbsp; But let it be known, I WANT a kitty really really badly! I gonna be stuck in purgatory for the rest of the afternoon, and I have to go get ready for that.&nbsp; (I have to babysit the three older kids, while interacting with Ken the drunken sot of an asshole&nbsp;and that&nbsp;equals intense misery).&nbsp; I've decided to just avoid the house all together while Ken is there, and take the kids up to Gyro Park No. 3, and pack a lunch for them.&nbsp; And that means I have to start making the lunch for them, and getting them dressed now, so as to be able to leave the minute Mom and Sherayna leave. so I'll ttyl, got to go prepare for utter death now.&nbsp; wish me luck.&nbsp; :(        "
3581210,male,InvestmentBanking,"             This may be a long blog...got a lot of thoughts going through my head this last couple of days, not least because of my reading  urlLink A Mathematician Plays the Stock Market --a very cool book and one that I wish I read before embarking on the  urlLink CFA  designation exams (wrote 2 of the 3 required exams already).  Anyhoo, went out for some drinks last night (yes, Thursday night, a school night, but I really wanted to break this jetlag and I find that going out is one of the most effective, and most fun, ways to do so) at a little place called Han's Sausages near Hong-Ik University (usually referred to as HongDae).  So upon ordering the bratwurst and beer I noticed something interesting, the beer came in a special pitcher that has dry ice in a compartment in the bottom of it and passages that allow the vapor to flow to the top and escape.  Pretty cool idea, and I had seen it before in another bar in Sinchon (another teen/bar district near HongDae).  While out on the town I started to think, 'What are the odds that I know someone here in this bar or meet them on the street?'  Likely pretty low, but then I remembered the last night I came here and got a call from an old co-worker who was basically 2 blocks from me and had just had &#49328;&#45209;&#51648; (san-nak-ji, living octopus) in a little place that we almost went to (now that was interesting).  Then I remembered that a friend of mine's former girlfriend is in Korea--not Seoul, in Pusan. But her sister-in-law's friend is engaged to a Korean girl in Daegu who often comes to Seoul (HongDae/Sinchon specifically) to see friends.  So, what if one of the thousands of people I saw were one of those friends?  How many  urlLink degrees of separation   is that?  Two to the Pusan friend (or one, if you count that I know her now), plus three to the groom-to-be (or two as the Pusan friend already knows her sister-in-law) and two more to the friend(s) in Seoul.  So that's 4 to 7 degrees, not bad.  I could also suppose that the people on the street know my wife or one of her friends (as she went to school there) but we are older than these kids and it's not quite as interesting a story as going to Vancouver then Daegu then back to Seoul.  Another area: yesterday I met some guys from an asset management firm here (for business).  One spoke quite good English, and when he found out I was from Vancouver he noted that his brother-in-law is living here.  As well, the owner of the  urlLink &#49340;&#44228;&#53461;  (samgyetang, ginseng chicken soup) place across from my apartment has a home in a suburb of Vancouver. What are the odds of that?  Now let's deconstruct this a bit, and take a bit from my current reading (and suspend for a bit the idea that I have incredible selective memory and am merely drawing connections from random events).  On the beer: both restaurants were in the same relative are (more or less) and it makes sense that a seller of those dry-ice pitchers would service both of them.  For the people on the street: the university district is full of school kids, school kids are not (usually, especially in Korea) destitute poor and they are (by definition) educated (or nearso) and it is the well-to-do and educated that end up going to foreign countries and meet/marry foreigners (there are exceptions, just humor me for a bit).  Thus, it makes some sense that I (who knows many educated people in Korea and Canada, as I am one myself) would have an ok chance to have some connection with similar people in another country, no matter the whereabouts.  (This reminds me of when I spent a month in the Philippines with my bud Carlo who met a friend there who ended up being his distant relative. Especially in places where the economic/social strata is well-defined the 'top 1%' seem to flock together.)  Concerning the people who have ties in Vancouver.  Proximity is one factor, and wealth is another.  Vancouver is the closest airport to Seoul (one hour longer to go to San Francisco) and it also has an inviting climate and seems to attract the wealthy from many countries (including the U.S.).  So it makes sense that these, again, well-to-do and educated people would have some connection to my other home.  What's my point and how does it lead to a better understanding of Korean culture?  It's this: When you meet a Korean (or when they are  urlLink on their first dates ) they will always ask questions to  urlLink figure out if they have some connection  such as  urlLink age  and ethnicity or school ties or anysuch thing that could prove a connection.  For foreigners this kind of questioning is sometimes seen as rude, but this is just a part of Korea: you get used to it.  This is one reason that Koreans study their butts off to go to the best/largest schools such as  urlLink Seoul National University ,  urlLink Korea University ,  urlLink Ewha Women's University  and  urlLink Yonsei University  and then put themselves through incredible stress to get into major companies such as  urlLink Samsung Group .  It's because after all that study and hard work one will have instant camaraderie with fellow alumni and, thus, be able to move to Vancouver when they retire and not have to work selling dry-ice beer pitchers to every bar in Korea.

As DJS might put it, me likey.  Speaking of DJS, Pete sang a song called 'burrito'.  I can't believe he's not DJS's soul mate.  On the surreal-in-a-good way front, I ran into a friend from high school at the show.  Its always really weird to see someone youve barely known since you were both 17 telling you that shes been married for 3 years.

I feel as if he is drawing me;  or not drawing me, drawing on me -drawing on my skin- not with a pencil, but with an old-fashioned goose pen, and not with the quill end but with the feather end.  As if hundreds of butterflies have settled all over my face, and are softly opening and closing their wings.  But underneath that is another feeling, a feeling of being wide-eyed awake and watchful.  It's like being wakened suddenly in the middle of the night by a hand over your face, and you sit up with your heart going fast, and no one is there.  And underneath that is another feeling still, a feeling of being torn open; not like a body of flesh, it is not painful as such, but like a peach; and not even torn open, but too ripe and splitting open of its own accord.                     and inside the peach there's a stone.'  That's not really how I felt, it just reminded me of that.  I'm much less dramatic about it.  I think that's everything.      "

4192173,male,Technology,"             Hi Ashley:  After an early breakfast this morning with my old pal the famous Martial Arts Cinema historian/Author (who hated KILL BILL by the way), I decided to stroll through Times Square in search of inspiration for my mom's Birthday gift. I hadn't been up there since G, Matt and I spent an evening with Wrestling Superstar Who Used to Be Shinobi. Anyway, I am a die hard New Yorker, to the end hopefully, but there is some weird shit in Times Square. Based on my experience today, I would like to tell you that we live in a world in which:  1. Robert Evans has an animated series about his life (that's actually a plus). 2. Posh Spice shills for hip hop clothing. What the FUCK. 3. Why is my agent/lawyer/advisor spending money for me and my girlfriend to see 'A Boy George musical' that is also a 'Rosie O'Donnell production'. This is BROADWAY? Where are the actors? 4. Jason Patric on Broadway. Nuff said. And no, he's not an actor, he's a method half ass. 5. And to make it worse, he is 'acting' opposite Ashley Judd. 6. Bubba Gump Shirmp Company opens on December 6th. I'll be at Sardi's thanks.  This is all I can think of it. It was too much. I hate myself. Anyway, I ended up getting mom tickets to see Hugh Jackman looking crazy disco gay in THE BOY FROM OZ. and yes, I'm going too. Dan Hamill just told me 'Moms love singing fags'. I would have agreed with this, but Jackman IS Wolverine, so he's tops in my books.  My 'celebrity' sighting was Robert Sean Leonard who looks like my relative who married a woman to cover the fact that he loved men. There's nothing wrong with that! Stop it! Gay is OK. Where the hell are the real stars!  Anyway, this sent me packing right into the Virgin Megastore where they expected me to spend 30 bucks on the new John Cale album. Luckily, Amazon UK has it for like 14 bucks. Screw you Branson. I ALMOST bought the new Interpol single cause it's the Arthur Baker remix, but its just two song. Lousy. Luckily I came to my senses and ran home, where I now have to go meet my former student, Edward, who is a nice guy.  Two more remixes have arrived: The first one comes all the way from Japan. SINO, who you can read about in the new Industrial Nation, took an interesting approach to DREAMS TO DEATH and made it a nasty machine dirge. It's very simple, but effective and fits in real nice on the EP. In the meantime, the lads in Cyanotic delivered their remix of THESE MILLION NIGHTS and have taken a drum n bass approach to it. Solid. I'm really happy with it and it gives us something we don't have yet on the record. One thing I have learned from all this is that Tom's vocals remix really well. Remixers love the smooth vocals.  Meanwhile I am working on a remix for a band you all know and love but are curious as to where their new album is. I am just as curious to be honest with you as I thought I would have it by now. Who knows. I'll get back to you on that. Also, I'll report back tonight or tomorrow after we get the crew together at the studio. Lots happening with HF. Till then...  F         "

3835942,male,indUnk,"           The weekdays rolled on too fast to me that at the end of it I realized that the weekend was not planned properly. I just thought I would visit the 'village' Paris.  This week was a bit boring.  The theme of 'village' Paris included the area stretching from Montmatre to Batignolles and the museums Musee de la vie Romantique and Musee de la Eroticisme.  I was wondering what would be a 'funiculaire' train. At the foot of the Butte Montmartre, there's this train which could take us to the top of it where the church of Sacre-Couer sat. Its a kind of a coach on rollers on an inclined plane. I took the stairs anyway, not wanting to part with my euros. The church was beautiful. The weather was very cloudy. From the top of the hill, I had a good panoramic view of a part of Paris equivalent to what I saw from the second stage of Tour Eiffel. Lots and lots of tourists. Most of them were speaking English. Maybe one of the reasons why the guy who drew a caricature of mine asked if I am from London!  I went inside the church just to see if there's anything worth seeing! To my dismay, nothing. All of the glory of any monument here, seems to be interwoven with its history. Without that its just another good piece of a building. After the prayer was over, it was good to see people shaking hands with whoever sat around them for the prayer. I was surprised to see a placard in Tamil asking the devotees for donation towards the water and electricity of the church. Thought that there are many Tamilians around there to visit the church. Maybe SriLankans, as there are plenty of them in Gare Du Nord. There were a couple of street-musicians as usual there too.  Beside the church, there’s 'Place du Tertre' where were a gathering of artists who drew everything from caricatures to portraits to landscapes. Different types of them too. Indeed to watch them paint and to see their finished work was really fantastic and awe-inspiring. One artist told me that he needed 50 euros to draw a portrait of mine. I withdrew. But the prices vary greatly depending on the type you need. For  sometime I thought of getting a portrait of mine  done. But I thought its too costly.  To go to the museums, the map said that I had to get down the hill and walk a bit further.  When I got down the hill where the narrow street led to a wide road across, a big building stared at me with its huge neon sign reading 'sexodrome'! I was taken aback a bit. An English lady screamed to her husband, 'how the hell did we reach  this hell of a place? the sex place!!'. Both sides of the road were full of sex shops hosting live shows, peep shows.... Quite a strange sight for me who has only seen streets dedicated to jewellery, garments and the like!  I realized that I am in Pigalle.  The street was demarcated by the two metro stations Pigalle and Blanche.  Took a slow walk along the walkway to see the shops. The pictures that were displayed outside the shops, glaring at the passersby were quite obscene- the kind of pictures that are banned even in cyber cafes in India! Pornography is quite public here!  I thought that people who live here, can come to this place, perform the sin, go up the hill to the church and confess it and go back home purified! Quite a smart way to live indeed!  Along the road was the Musee de la Eroticisme! It was a small building. I entered it and saw that the entree[sic] fee was 7 euros. I looked around. The room was full of lewd statues and porno. Surely, I don’t want to spend my money here!  Then while walking down the street, a woman who was wooing the pedestrians into a shop, came running and said 'Excuse me, Sir' and began to pour out words in French. I didn’t turn back to her fearing that that might be taken as a sign of approval! I almost started running! Its quite a disgusting place.  I thought that I should not buy sex. Instead I should earn it. If I earn it, then it means that it comes with love and it'll take me to heaven. If I buy it, it'll become an indelible thorn of steel in my heart and given the kind of character I am, it would surely kill me! Its so fatal. So I'll better remain away from this. But the problem is, I always think that I am not smart enough to 'earn' it. There's a great probability that I'll be a failure in this regard. Its very rare to come across people who earn their sex. The majority satisfy their appetite either by buying it or begging for it or settling for something cheap. I do not want to do anything of these.  And when I think of Love, I realize that its so elusive that those who seek it will not find it. The choice is not ours but Her's!  The 'Moulin Rouge' which was glorified by the eponymous Hollywood flick, starring Nicole Kidman, is in this street. I went to the street again the next day night to take a picture of that windmill placed on that mall, lit. While taking the picture and returning back too, I was accosted by a man who showed a shining card and pointed to a narrow street nearby and said 'there are beautiful girls there, sir?'. Instead of running away, this time I paused and  said, 'No.Thanks'! After all, he too is a human being and in a sense, we both are beggars! The boredom which I go through is making me one!  Getting quite repugnant of the place and thinking of seeing those artists again at the top, I went to Place du Tertre and then to the church. There I sat at the steps. I was sweating due to the uphill climb and I took off the jacket and felt the chill air on my warm wet skin.  At this moment, I couldn’t quite grasp why, I felt really completely lonely. The old feeling of boredom which used to kill me while I was in Bangalore got its grip again on me! I felt tired and bored of the whole thing! Paris has failed to remove this sense of boredom from me. Then I started pondering about my favourite, unanswerable, ever-mysterious question of my career. Till now, I could not find what would enthuse me.  It seems that my mind is altogether inconsonant with whatever I experience, be it anywhere, anytime! I desperately want to find something which resonates with my mind. Or else its better to die, than going through this boredom and loneliness and the feeling of worthlessness. I am sure that with this sense of detachment to anything I cannot achieve anything in my life and am already a failure. But somehow this fact doesn’t seem to bother me. I always think that its perfectly fine to be a failure. Maybe that’s one of the reasons why I cannot find what I really want out of my life. Everything still looks meaningless, even though they are beautiful!   After resting outside the church, I got up with no specific place in my mind and roamed around the streets of Montmartre, which they say had inspired even some of the great thinkers who frequented the place. Quite a good place. Calm and serene. The narrow streets, typical of a village, without any tourist noise are good to be in.  Later in the evening I went to the village of Belleville just to see what’s there. But when I got out of the metro station onto the roads, the first impression of that place and the smell of it wasn’t good. To forget that hangover, I went to the 'timeless' Paris again, where I've been last week, to take a picture of Pont Neuf across river Seine lit in the night. As I expected, that place had a magic touch! I felt good again. Took some pictures and returned to my room.  Since I was bored this day I thought going of nowhere the morrow and went to sleep!  While returning to my room, in the metro, I saw a person who can neither be called a boy nor a man. Somewhere in between, like me. I liked his countenance. Lots of hair, clean cut of his nose and a 2-day old beard. He was reading a book and when I saw it I envied him! It was Victor Hugo's Les Contemplations. I felt like learning French to read Victor Hugo, Voltaire , Rene Descartes and the like - the kind of men who are keeping me alive and who make me realize that there’s nothing to get bored and there’s a universe to learn and contemplate upon. Its a  never-ending quest! I only wish to ask them, 'THEN WHAT?'!  I couldn’t sleep beyond broad daylight at 7:30AM.And again got bored of the room! So I went to Musee de la vie Romantique and Jardin du Luxembourg.   The museum, unlike what the name suggests, was not at all romantic! In fact I found boring portraits of the Rouart family of artists and a not at all beautiful woman artist called George Sand and the materials they used and even their hair sample! I wrote in the visitor's book 'Nothing romantic about this!'. Got really pissed off.  At times, while strolling around this paradise, I feel a bit of wonder to think that I am at the opposite side of the world , so far from India, wearing the same jeans and T-shirt which I wore in Bangalore. And I feel a bit of sadness when I realise that I had to return! Dreams only last until you realize that they are dreams! Now the dream has ceased to be.  I expected the garden of Luxembourg to be huge and beautiful. But it was pretty small, even though beautiful. Spent some time there and then went to Gare du Nord as usual to buy cookeries with my roommates Amarnath and Srinand and returned to the room.          "

3869393,female,Technology,"       Looks like I have been cursed with regards to my weekends, something or another goes wrong with me here!  My saturday was quite disturbing to say the least.  Actually, most of this started off on Friday evening, when I kindof went into this lull and complete depression.  The birthday party brought back a whole lot of memories for me and that absolutely ripped thro' my soul, I could feel this agonizing pain run thro' my heart.  Friday evening, I needed a change desperately after the gloomy time I had at office, and headed to the beach for a walk.   Man, one weird thing, but somehow usually the beach tends to calm my nerves down and it did a good job, but the effects were only temporary.  I walked at the beach, one solid brisk walk for 30 minutes and then picked up my aunt and headed home.  Rest of the day was most uninteresting to say the least!  Saturday start was a touch dull and boring, but towards the afternoon the spice began.  No idea really what happend to me, all I do know ws that I was hit by a hurricane.  All the medicines which I had been consuming, with god only knows what else began to takes its toll on me.  It all started off with a headache, nagging one.  I thought okay, must be one of those pshyco things, picked up a few DVDs and headed back home.  Watched this movie called HUM TUM, hindi movie, which if literally translated means, We U...!  The movie was one really good one, and personally enjoyed it, due to two reasons, It gave me some relief from my thinking mode and two, It re instilled by faith that our life is a long one, one never knows when and where their paths with cross and with whom, the uncertainity is really what makes life interesting and not driven by pain.  As I was completing up with this movie,  my little cousin called me and informed me that a group of us were heading to Spidey 2 and tickets had been purchased for me too.  So it was spidey time, the movie was pretty well made, good and worthy sequel.  But then towards the end of the movie, my headache got really bad and from absolutely no where this feeling of naseua took over me.  I headed back home at 7pm, and hit the sack.  Think I slept for 15 mnutes, and the nxt thing I knew was tht I was feeling so absolutely queezy in life & was running between the loo and my bedroom, poppin medicines.  This was a horrible feeling for me, and the pain of being stuck in such a situation was miserable to say the least.  Then as though my probs were not bad enough, my body decided to play a nasty game with me, and I developed severe muscle cramps at about 9pm.     With no medicine having any effect on me, courtesy of throwing up stuff over and over, I headed to my grandpa, to seek some emotional strength.  The pain simply began to take over my senses completely and there was hardly a minute I could stay without thinking of my soulmate, he was always this person who wanted to be with me when I was sick and in pain...haha, when I needed him the most, he just couldnt be there for me.  So ironic....after all that has happend in my life off late, all the nasty stuff said, all the pain caused for people around, all the sadness which still fills my heart, and all the so called anger which I am to have towards him, I still couldnt stop thinking about him thro' every second of those 7 hours of pain!  7 hours of pain which ripped thro' me completely, so bad that the doctors at home are quite baffled with my body.    Anyway, this pain continued on and on, medicines were having no effect at all me.  Even my uncle who is a doctor came in at 3:30am in the morning to give me relief, but all went in vain. Finally with no choice left at all, I was given an injection, and that knocked me out at 4:30am.  All the pain seriously got to me and I couldnt even hold myself.  Couldnt tell my parents even that I had a blackout the previous day, coz then they would get seriously worried.   Should be heading to the hospital this evening to do a complete checkup, since I totally scared everyone out of their skins today.  God...why the hell am I being put thro this emotional and physical torture....its killing me....I've stopped asking questions, so why stil this emotional and physical turmoil for me!!!         "

4192173,male,Technology,"             My 'lovely underage girlfriend' and I were the sole MOGpackers to represent the most recent Saintface show on Saturday day night.  The gig was held in what used to be known as the 'the Cooler' on 14th btw 9th and Washington (sidenote: my only memory of the Cooler was an AFI gig I was supposed to see there in November, 1999.  I was so anxious for that show as it would have been the first time in two years that i had seen them.  Unfortunately, I never made it to the show.  I had gone home after work and was halfway out my door when I received a phone call from then recent ex-gf, who since is being referred to as 'the hussy'.  She started a fight and held me up just long enough to have to miss the show.  I then had to resort to seeing AFI the following night in SUFFOLK COUNTY at a biker bar.  That's a whole other story.  But upon seeing how small and nicely set up the COoler is, I was angered all over again...feeling 21 again...something that my lovely companion cannot claim.).  The space is set up in a very cool way.  Decent size stage that is rather low to the ground, couches and stools in the actual performance area; a separate bar area (yes Frank, they had Stella); and a totally separate lounge type area.  Very cool space.  My companion and I got to the venue at 11.30, just to time to catch the last two songs of the final support act, The New Years.  I have to say - I liked them.  Their look definitely needs polishing (bass player was sporting a sleeveless t (surfer style) and an eyebrow ring), but the sound was pretty good - hipster rock with more of an edge and even the occasional post-hardcore drone.  I look forward to checking them out again.  For the main event, Peter Saintface made sure he wouldn't remember it.  Aside from that the band was tight playing mostly new tracks probably heard at the Mercury Lounge gig a few weeks back (by the by - they're back there in August - on a Saturday night.  Well done!), and included one entirely new 'under-rehearsed' track.  I wish I could describe it for you but I'm too tried.  The set overall was very good eventhough I don't get to hear my faves from back in the '00.  One lighter point of the evening: two Poontang girls made an appearance along with some Dutch dude who was there to have 'fun!'.  No names, but when Peter sang a few words and pointed to one IP gal, she swooned hardcore.  When the same happened to me, I felt overwhelmed with wanderlust.  Dave Gahan on Wednesday night.  Looking forward.  Scary thing about this show: I checked ticketbastard.com this morning and tix were still available on the floor of the Hammerstein!!!  Crazy, but he apparently plays some fun stuff, so I am excited.  'til the end' M.         "

589736,male,Technology,"           Does any country know how to solve complex problems?  It seems analogous to hoping that a single wave will reshape a coastline.  Change occurs over long periods of time, according to the effects of many disparate forces, each acting separately and often without any awareness of the other.  The best anyone can hope for is to be one of those myriad disparate forces.  A human lifetime is too short a span to allow for complete understanding of long-term change.  My fear is for movements that lack proper perspective.  How many of us recall one isolated incident with our parents that redirected our entire lives for the worse, in some way, leaving a permanent scar?  Yet at that moment, the parent perceived that the action was warranted and appropriate.  It seems to me that wisdom begins with perspective.  And perspective is what the current anti-war movement seems to lack.  A shame, really, because the forces they are protesting -- the hawks of the right -- seem to me, to lack perspective themselves.  Us and Them, targeting issues and each other, firing wide, missing the mark, perpetuating the illusion of dialogue, while History does its own thing in the middle of it all, heedless of the sound and fury.

883178,male,Fashion,"           F It...It's the Friday Five!   1. What is your favorite type of literature to read (magazine, newspaper, novels, nonfiction, poetry, etc.)?    I like novels and admittedly, I read mostly fiction.  I tend to stay away from newspapers and magazines of substance because I like to stay pleasantly uninformed.  Turns out, I'm not missing much.   2. What is your favorite novel?  My favorite novel?  That's a tough one.  I guess I'll just list SOME of my favorite novels.  I really liked Stephen King's  'Misery.'   It was a bajillion times better than that pathetic movie they made with Kate Bates and Jim Caan.  The movie was Candyland in comparison.  (ooooh...big revelation, the book was better.)  I also like the book  'Filth'  by Irvine Welsh quite a bit.  Then again, I like just about everything that gadge writes.  This is a hard question to answer...it's kind of like asking me what my favorite movie is.   3. Do you have a favorite poem? (Share it!)  It's too long to write, but it's  The Cremation of Sam McGee.   You can read it  urlLink here .  I've never been a big poetry buff, but the ones I really tend to like are ones with a story.  Call me a simpleton, but I'm a sucker for a clever tale...    4. What is one thing you've always wanted to read, or wish you had more time to read?  Either the Bible or Dianetics, though I probably never will.  I really want to see what all these religious kooks are making such a big fuss about.  Plus, I want to read about Scientology so I can make fun of it and not feel so guilty.   5. What are you currently reading?  Right now, I'm reading a children's novel by Cornelia Funke called  'The Thief Lord.'   It's pretty good.  Supposedly, she's like almost as popular as JK Rowling in other parts of the world.  I'll probably finish it this weekend and prepare myself for  'The Return of the King.'          "

It's hard for me to think in the first place, but now it's like whoa. Actually you know what I've figured all these blogs probably don't make sense or like I can't write like anything profound in them because I always write them at like  12:30 am or like 1 am. pretty hard to make up big words then. See I would write them earlier, but I don't want to write them during the day 'cause well the days not over and something big could happen and then I don't even get home or have people leave till 12.... so I have no choice.  Yeah so my sister leaves for college tomorrow!!! The car will be all mine and so will the basement and everything, muh haha! Except with the car I have to pay for gas to drive and I need money to pay for gas, but I can't get money without a job, and right now I don't have a job so therefore I can't get money and can't pay for gas and then not drive which would suck major balls.  So lately I've been busy, Friday I went to Valley Fair, Saturday MOA (Mall of America for those who don't know), Sunday I was at a car wash for hockey for like 4 and a half hours where were made about $500, and then today I went to school, ya yuck, and was there for like 2 hours 'cause of my article and then I went to Janelle's tonight. It was fun being in the pub (publication room) though 'cause ya I got to hang out with some people I hadn't seen all summer that I used to always hang out with in school. That's the ONE reason why I'm excited for school to start, to see long time friends, haha. Ok so Nick is a dumbass..... tonight when I was driving home, he left with Fred at the same time, they drove in front of me all the way home extremely slow so that I would be home late, even though it doesn't matter, but ya he'd go like 10 mph and then on turns he like would barely turn and then he blocked me out of the driveway! But ya it's funny 'cause when he was really slow I would speed up on the side of him and try to pass but my car is too damn slow so that even when he was braked and I never did he would just speed up and be right  in front of me again...... one of these days though I will win in car racing!!!

I've changed modes from listening to music just at my desk, to wearing my earphones all around the office.  I get weird looks, but it makes me a happier worker.    I'm listening to that Carbon Leaf song.  I've been talking about it way too much this week.  Sorry. No I'm not, I have to put up with your shit like all the time, the least you can do is humor me for one goddamn minute!    I can't wait to do absolutely nothing this weekend.  I'm gonna watch the rest of QAF and Buffy, but that's about it.  I'm not even going to do laundry.  Oh shit I think I have to cook dinner for T & J this weekend.  Just in case I leave my sister's like you better cook for us.  I think I'm just gonna brown some chicken breast in olive oil and make some pasta.  Hell I like it.  And maybe throw together some Italian wedding soup. yum yum, bubble gum, in my tum, 'gimme some!'    I'm in such a weird mood today.  I don't know if it's 'cause it's such a nice day, but who the hells knows.  I surely don't.  I kinda wish I had a digital video camera 'cause the birds were around again and I wanna show y'ins 'cause it's really cool.    Oh they were talking about Heinz field today on the radio and how some of the players from some other team were told to 'mark their territory.'  So they peed on the field.  I only wish that I had peed on it when I broke in 'cause then I'd call the station and be like 'well I already marked it.'    Well that's about it right now.

3485026,male,Student,"       I have been thinking a lot so far this summer, just about my life in general, law school, and its direction.  Law school has started to become a double edged sword in my life.  I love the intellectual challenge, the order that the law can potentially bring to things, and the opportunity it can give.  At the same time, law school seems very dark.  Most people are pessimistic and distrusting concerning human nature.  Sometimes, the nature of the very inquiries we are being trained to make assumes that people are inherently bad, and  that when someone acts in an honorable and noble way, that it is the exception.  Maybe this is true of all of society, but I know that the concept is overwhelmingly prevalent at law school.  Anyway, I am not sure where I am going with this, it just something that has occupied some of my thinking lately.  In addition, with Jackie graduating from SJC, she is now 2 to 2 1/2 hours away...and with her working two jobs, me in classes, gas prices being what they are, just seems like a recipe for a very stressful summer.  The worse is that the future is so open ended with her job...depending on if and where she finds a teaching job, the next year before our marriage could end being very trying...trying not on the relationship, just on each of us individually.  When she comes to visit, I am able to deal with the stress of classes better, I laugh more, I live more, and in general and a much happier person.  Being here by myself leaves me alone with my thoughts too much, and I don't like where my mind goes sometimes.  Overall, depressing thoughts have started to creep back into my life, and I hate that they have, especially when I know that there is so much good present in my life.  Seems like things pile on... the uncertainty concerning the next year and beyond, the dissatisfaction with the atmosphere of law school, the living alone, hardly seeing Jackie or my other friends, and questioning what I should be doing with my life...  Part of my overall frustration with things I know is traceable to the fact that I don't have a job this summer and I'm stuck taking summer classes.  I know that the classes are better than doing nothing and working a typical summer job, but oddly enough, I miss working...I miss the feeling of doing something productive and seeing the results of it, a weird advantage to those summer jobs.  My life has turned into a routine of books...which wouldn't be all that bad if I were choosing the books, and maybe doing some writing, instead of reading law case books and just having to attempt to hold onto all the information...  At this point, I just hit on something...'maybe doing some writing.'  I have always held that in the back of my mind, that I would love to write.  Problems are that I do not possess good technical writing skills, and I can never decide on a direction, so anything I start to write seems to be completely sporadic, much like this and other journal entries.  Sometimes I think that writing might be a solution for me, something that would give more purpose than just the law school, but something the law school could help me with.  Still, it always comes back to the issue of what would I write about, what topic or group of topics would interest me sufficiently to put the time and effort into writing something substantial.  I think about writing about some philosophical ideas, but I am to indecisive about those topics, and not sure if I can really discuss them at a great depth.  I then think about writing about religion, and specifically my experiences with it and how I came to discover God again, and the general relations between the religions that I see, but who is interested in what I think...in reality, the only aspect concerning religion that I feel a lot of passion about is how people tend to compartmentalize their life, and leave religion, God, and so forth out of their day to day routines...but I don't think I could write for very long on that, which would then turn into an essay and nothing substantive, and I'v written essays, I have this desire to write something more substantial, something that is thoroughly in depth on a subject...and then I wonder if I have the patience to actually write something that is substantial and thorough.  Oh well, I guess I have exhuasted some of my thoughts for now...I will leave myself with a message from the Dalai Lama, words of wisdom...  'It seems that often when problems arise, our outlook becomes narrow.  All of our attention may be focused on worrying about the problem, and we may have a sense that we're the only one that is going through such difficulties,  This can lead to a kind of self-absorption that can me the problem seem very intense.  When this happens, I think that seeing things from a wider perspective can definitely help - realizing, for instance, that there are many other people who have gone through similar experiences, and even worse experiences.  This practice of shifting perspective can even be helpful in certain illnesses or when in pain.  At the time the pain arises it is of course often very difficult, at that moment, to do formal meditation practices to calm the mind.  But if you can make comparisons, view your situation from a different perspective, somehow something happens.  If you only look at that one event, then it appears bigger and bigger.  If you focus too closely, too intensely, on a problem when it occurs, it appears uncontrollable.  But if you compare that event with some other greater event, look at the same problem from a distance, then it appears smaller and less overwhelming.'

883178,male,Fashion,"            Satisfactory in St. Paul  By Duf Play Orange Crush, Damnit Fer  Last night, at the R.E.M. show, I found myself thinking a lot about the event as a description of my demographic.  The American middle class, ages 30 to 40, largely white (your humble author excluded), largely educated, largely interested in staying in touch with the side of self that rocked from time to time.  What became apparent is that time has worn away our ambitions; we have aged with our performers.   Michael Stipe and the gang came out and started off with three energy filled and older R.E.M. standards (I should look them up, but Im at work and need to hurry this along).  Stipe was a whirlwind of energy dancing and throwing his arms, jumping and cavorting.  He talked about his penis.  But as the show continued on, his energy lagged.  The overall energy lagged.  Concert energy is a weird symbiotic thing.  One can get bogged down in wondering whether the band creates the energy and the crowd feeds off of it, or whether the crowd creates the energy and the band feeds off it.  Most would acknowledge that both the band and the crowd have the ability to create and kill a good vibe.  The best shows are those where the two work together to create a phenomenal energy (see, e.g. the Pearl Jam show at the Xcel Energy Center this past June).  Last night, in St. Paul, a great concert was made good by a lack of energy (HAL and Panda will recall our Coldplay show in Chicago where the band showed up to rock, but the fans did not).  As I analyze what depleted the energy last night, what Im left with is the following:  R.E.M. by its set selection, failed to follow a pattern that promotes an energetic response.  For my money, the best concerts follow one of three formulas.    Formula one:  The concert starts kind of low (slower tempo song that scream warm up) and finishes high leaving an emotional peak at the end.  This is one of my favorite models.  The band knows their entrance is good for 15 minutes worth of energy, use that to play slow and low.  Formula two:  or, what I call the inverted bell curve:  bands start high, bring things down a bit and then finish high again.  Not a personal favorite, but I have seen it done very well.  Formula three:  is the (extremely difficult and rarely pulled off formula) of starting high and staying high all night.  Bands that hope to pull this off need to draw on a number of things:  a selection of up tempo rocking songs that they can play for two hours, a crowd that will, with them, keep things at a fever pitch, and an emotional hook (the loss of an important person to the band, or a homecoming, a reunion show, or a retirement show, anger, glee, drugs (not kidding) something, anything).  Last night, R.E.M. followed what I call the EKG model where they vacillated to closely between up tempo songs and down tempos songs.  Any D.J. worth a turntable investment will tell you there is a value in having some connection (in tempo or in theme from one song to the next).  The EKG model is not conducive to good energy. At one point I felt like I was at mass. Sit down, stand up, sit down, stand up.  Second, Stipe talked too much.  I know that concert conversations can build intimacy, and his stories were great, but if cutting the comments in half would have allowed a couple of more songs (like, oh, say Orange Crush), I think we all would have been better off.  Third, they did not play Orange Crush.  Fourth, the show was not sold out  that can keep a band flaccid like nothing else.  In the age of $75 dollar tickets, it is clear that the stakes are higher.  Concertgoers are right if they expected the band to do most of the heavy lifting.  I also suspect that there is actuarial methodology around the benefits of having a nearly sold out show at $75 per seat instead of a sold out show at $50 per seat.  While it is not egalitarian, my thought is that tiered pricing is the way to go  it allows your fans to come without being limited by income restrictions.  Sure, its yucky that those who have more money to spend can get better seats, but at least more people can go.  In any event, the show was not sold out, and I think that contributed as an energy drain.    Fifth, to dovetail on my opening comment, I think our beloved band, and its beloved fans, are part of a demographic that desperately wants to rock and truly wants to go all night long, but just cant do it.  My concert friend (as my brother in law calls her) are thirty somethings, and we danced all night at Pearl Jam, but I think we were inspired by our younger co-goers who have the metabolism to rock non-stop.  Without them last night, we were not ashamed to sit from time to time.  But about my demographic:  we have to recharge our Starbucks card, we have schedule maintenance for our traction control cars, and we have a spreadsheet due right after our 9:00 conference call.  Like many of the folks at the concert last night, we want to think we can stand up for two hours of great rock and roll, but instead, our default setting is to sit for fine entertainment.

883178,male,Fashion,"           I need to get back in the writing swing of things.  Word around the workplace here has it that there's a certain fellow on another team that can draw the pants off of anyone on the floor.  The supervisor for said artiste brought his sketchbook by and my jaw literally hit the floor.  This guy has mad, mad, mad talent.  Imagine the coolest looking little children's picture book you've ever seen and add 10 on top of that.  That's how good he is.  Since my novel has stalled since my move and the release of  'Grand Theft Auto: Vice City' , I haven't had the urge to finish my newest book.  It's currently stuck on page 110, where my kid hero is stuck in a swamp and is being attacked by spawning bog beasts.  Don't ask.    I looked at this guy's journal with total admiration and I decided that we needed to collaborate, that's all there was to it.  He claims he can't write very well.  I can't draw to save mine or anyone else's life.  Wonder Twin powers...ACTIVATE!  I sent him this e-mail and told him we needed to work on a project together.  He accepted!

883178,male,Fashion,"            My First Guess   Duf, as a woman with (fairly) normal womanly traits, I know how we have tendencies to express something (perhaps very strongly), while actually being concerned about something totally different.  Here's what I think is happening: Mrs. Duf is frustrated.  She's under a lot of pressure and as a modern woman, has taken on many roles: 1) Super Mom, 2) Career Woman, 3) Wifey of Duf Fer.  Personally, I think there is more pressure on the woman to be  perfect  at all Three.  Men can slack a bit on #1 or #3 and get away with it because 'they're bringing home the bacon'.  Of course, this is crap, but society (or the horrid media) dictates this.  (Another reason I still wish it were the 50s.)  So when Mrs. D says 'things need to change around here'...you may think she's talking about the order of the house. (Men tend to take things more literally than women.) However, I think she just wants you to be aware that she's going to need your support.  Not just with the vacuuming or putting Tiny E to bed, but emotionally as well.  She needs to know you'll be around to pick up the slack.  Also, you traveling a lot probably makes the Mrs worried about things falling behind at home.  Talk to her and tell her what you told us in your post.  I'm sure she's more concerned with the cleanliness of your relationship than with the bathroom.  Convince her that you have her back...  But again, this is just my guess.         "

If you haven't read it, check it out at  urlLink www.onpointmediagroup.com/blog . It's hilarious!! I slept a lot in an attempt to kick this cold that's been haunting me for a week.  Every now and then we look back on our decision to move here and have a fleeting thought of wondering if we did the right thing. Ked had been super stressed at his previous job. He was so overworked and underpaid. Now everyone says that they're overworked and underpaid, but in Ked's case he knew he was doing the work of three people. Daily he faced the sinking feeling of knowing there was more work than he could ever possibly get done. When he left we were curious to see what they would do to replace him. Just last week we heard that in fact, they are hiring their THIRD full time employee to replace him. Yes, we were right. He was doing the work of three people. They hired a graphic designer, a web programmer, and now are hiring a web manager who will handle the design aspects. We just laughed. It's self-gratifying to know it really did take three people to replace him.  Today was a beautiful day. When Ked got home from work we hit the trail for a 2 mile jog/walk. It was cloudy and breezy and the perfect temperature to sweat a little but not overheat. Our senses were confronted with the smell of freshly cut grass bringing back all the nostalgia of spring. Along the way we saw a few trees and bushes just starting to bloom again. The birds were gathering and chirping in full force. I think they were making their travel arrangements to head back north. I love seeing everything come alive in the spring.  It's going to be a busy and fun week with Karon arriving tomorrow! I'll keep you posted on our adventures.                "

467705,female,indUnk,"       Listening to:  Stevie  by Yesterdays New Quintet  I had a dream about Mama the other night.  She was bedridden; her body wasnt whole.  She was sickly looking, wasting away, her head covered with peach fuzz that couldnt grow back any thicker.  She looked very much the way she did in the last few weeks she was still alive, but in my dream she was just a torso and head, no arms or legs.  In my dream she said to me, Kiss  ko ,  anak ko  (Kiss me, my child).    Before Mama went unconscious [her body took weeks to shut down, little by little], she said to me, Kiss  ko , baby  ko  whenever she was aware that I was by her side.  Whenever I sat by her, she told me she loved me and I told her I loved herI never left her without saying it because I was always afraid it would be the last time for me to say it to her or to hear it from her.  The day after Mama went into her coma, Daddy called me, crying, telling me to go to Bakersfield.  He said the night before Mama's condition got even worse (to the point where she was just barely holding on), he and my Auntie Thelma were praying with her and she said something, but he couldn't make it out.  He said after she repeated it a couple of times, he realized she was calling for me.  I drove for four hours to be by Mama's side, early the next morning; the second I walked through the door and went to her, she focused her eyes on me for a bit.  Then they rolled back into her head; I slept on the floor next to her that night.  The following evening she passed away.   Sigh.   A couple days ago I also dreamed about my boss.  Her father passed away from cancer also; he died about a week ago.  My friend Ks father also passed away from cancer a couple of months ago.  K didnt know my mom passed away til last week, when we talked a little bit about our experiences.  Mel mentioned to me that a new Hyphen staffer on the edit team's mom was recently diagnosed with breast cancer (my mom had breast cancer).  Crazy.    Ive been toying around with putting together a fundraiser.  I know I want to have a big joint birthday party with Adrienne in September, so maybe that could be it?  Charge like $5 at the door and donate all the proceeds to the American Cancer Society in my moms memory.  Well see.  Anyhow. Sorry to go on about cancer and death so early in the morning.  Hmmm  This morning is the exception, but generally I have this routine of watching the news as I get ready.  I watch local news on Channel 3 and NBCs Today Show.  Yes, I loves me some Matt Lauer.  Um, is it bad that I find Scott Peterson to be attractive?  I mean he's got that tall, dark, handsome, brooding thing going on.  But then again, that whole dark/brooding thing could just be my own personal bias from all the trial coverage Ive seen.  Really, though, hes a good-looking man.  Once I glossed over the cover of a tabloid paper while at the grocery store and the picture of him made me do a double take.  From the angle, I thought he looked like my old USSC (Ultimate Super Secret Crush).  They look similar, but my USSCs face isnt so angular and his eyes are more Asian looking (my [old] USSC is hapa/ mestizo /half Asian).  And how about the hot 23-year old teacher who had sex with one of her students?  So Mary Kay Letorneau.  Sounds like the average adolescent males fantasy to me, no?  I thought about itand go ahead and think Im screwed upbut if Mr. Rapp (my 8th grade history teacher) or Mr. Davis (my 12th grade AP History teacher) wanted to seduce me when I was younger  HOLLA!  But its not like at 13 or 16 I wouldve really known what was going on.  Like, Why is your thing all big and sticking straight out?  It looks funny...  You wanna put it in my what?   WHAT!?    Ay naku .  For real.  Yikes.  Aiight, I gotta get back to Hatty about this e-flyer design for the Hyphen event.  And search for these last 11 publications on Bacon's for a big media mailing on Tuesday.  My work is never done.    Have a happy holiday weekend.  Drive safe, eat lots of barbecue, dont use illegal fireworks and blow your hand off, and all that good stuff.

883178,male,Fashion,"            Tuesday Two, y'all, Tuesday Two, y'all.  Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday Two y'all!    1. If you could live the life of a famous or successful person for one day, who would it be? Why?    That's easy.  I would be Tiger Woods.  My hope that one day would be long enough for me to pick up some things from his golf swing and groove them into my muscle memory.  I could also know what it feels like to hit a ball 300+ yards and have people stare at me adoringly.   2. What one musical group forces you to change the channel instantly when one of their songs plays on the radio?    For me it's a four-way tie:  Anything by Meatloaf (although he is rarely on the radio anymore), anything by the Violent Femmes (please die 'Blister in the Sun', please - it was great the first million times I heard it, and now I absolutely cannot stand it at all, not even a little bit and don't get me started on 'Do you like American Music?'  Arrrggghhh!).  That one song by the Suburbs that they play here too much...(when will it die?)...and that is similar to this one other song I destest by the Meat Puppets ('Johnny loves Janie, Janie love Paul womp, womp, womp, womp....).  It's horrible.  Horrible.  I'm upset just thinking about it.  Ick.  Meatloaf fans, let me feel ya'.         "
3705830,male,Non-Profit,"       in a moment of clarity i looked up the tablature for 'tightrope', by the stone roses. a truly beautiful wonderful song, and one that i have every intention of playing at some point when the mysterious 'band' gets together. acoustic singalongs were never so cool:  are we etched in stone,  or just scratched in the sand waiting for the waves to come  and reclaim the land?   and then, in a moment of complete insanity, i looked up the tablature for 'good times', by the stone roses. why? delusions of adequacy, and nothing more. oh my good god, there is no way i will ever ever learn to play that. [aside: i probably could, but it would need to be a full-time job and i'm fairly sure no-one's going to pay me for that, alas.] i get as far as 0:26 and then its into the main riff and i've no space to fit all those notes in.   it brings up the issue of 'the second coming', though, which is a vastly underrated album in my opinion. to have those two completely different songs next to each other and to have it work is an indication of something, even if five years is a long time to wait. definitely worth having; good summer guitar tunes. disregarding the rain, that is.   interesting fact: on the set of '24 hour party people', i met the fake john squire - that is, the actor playing john squire in the film. and yet, he doesn't appear in the film at all. shame; he had good john squire hair. presumably left on the cutting room floor...  n.

I hate the suburbs and she and her fiance live so far out that it takes 30 minutes and $2.50 in tolls roundtrip from my apartment in town.  So driving, I saw this mini cooper with the license plate 'SUVS SUC.'  Now, I know we guzzle gas and are ruining the ozone, but I really wanted to pull his little mini ass over and challenge him to play chicken with my SUV.  I'd squash him.  He'd be like a crumple soda can after slamming into my Sport (luxury) Utility (hauling shoes and pretty purses) Vehicle.  So, you mini man, watch who you're picking on.

3667495,male,Science,"                 There once was a baby named Bo Jangles. When he was born his parents were told that he was blind, but Bo wasn't blind. The doctors were foreign, and they believed that he was blind because of this really light colored eyes. While growing up he tryed to convince his parents that he wasnt blind, but they would never listen. So he started to pretend he was blind. The only person that believed him was a kid named JohnReed. Both of their fathers were highly involved in the  MOb.(organized crime) While JOhn's dad was the boss. Bo's dad was the right hand man. So there familys were really good friends.(Like family) One day JOhn was making fun of Bo's blindness by throwing a apple at Bo at a mob meeting. BO,not being blind,caught it.Then john asked bo what color his hair was. Bo was like brown 'freak'. John realized how cool Bo was and they became best friends.  They were kinda stupid.Yeah so they got like lost a whole bunch. So one day Bo Jangles and JohnReed were on there way to the gas station to pick up some tacos. They desided to take a short cut throw the corn field. And geuss what??? they got lost. so they started going throw the corn rows when all of a sudden they spoted a sign. It read dont mess with the crotch-goblins. John Reed siad,'Caitlin Kyle,this girl @ school is always talking about those things.' AlL of a sudden a C-GOB bounced on BO Jangles head and hiss at him. Bo, took the C-GOB and took it off his head and took a bite out of it. 'Taste like some sorta weirdness'. 'I dont think u should have ate that,stupid',said JohnRxxd.'I dont care', Bo said. All of a sudden there was a nosie coming from the corn rows. 'WHAT DID U DO TO MY C-GOB!!' It WAS CAITLIN!! 'Hey caitlin!',said John. Hey john. n/m Which one of u ate the c-gob. did u realize that was the last one left? bO SIAD,'SOrry i didnt realize it.' caitlin runs over to bO and beats him up. Caitlin then realizing that it didnt really matter ask them why they are in the midddle of a corn field. John answers,' we were on a qwest for tacos but we got really lost!!'.'I can i join i think i could help.?',saids caitlin. They answer yes and continue on there mission.Day turned to night and they began to get tierd. THey could barely see anything when they walked rightt into a man. The man was really tall. Bo took out this keyring flashlight and tapped on this back. the man turned around. It was BoB the janitor.WHat the heck?'Mr. bob .What are u doing in the corn field. Very simple,Mr.reed.I am Jeepers Creepers. I am inside of bob, u know using his body!!! 'Really',said Bo. 'Since U have found out my secert i will send u one person to help u'. The 3 kids huddle togther to think of a person. We want       .'O wAIT i ONLY NOW one person. i only have one friend. i meet this girl playing on-line bingo a while ago. i told her i had no friends and she told me that she would be my friend,. i WILL SEND HER to u!'Thanks' they siad. All of A SUDDEN a girl appears and jeepers creepers flys away. 'It cant be,Danielle?',says john. 'Aww, one mintue i am in bed the next in this corn field.'You all have some explaining to do'. THEY expalined all to danielle. 'So i geuss i am stuck with u guys', saids danielle.I geuss its not all that bad.  They continued. After a while they all got disscouraged and begun to believe they were lost 4ever. But while walking through the corn field caitlin tripped over a bar typed object, it was a water spicket. they all took a drink . and then all went to sleep. the next day when they woke up, they figured out that the wtare had been magical! tHey all had turned mult-colored. iT was so weird. bUT the effect wasnt perment. thanx goodness. They continued on there qwest. they found a small shack. they all could barely fit into it. it was filled with cotton candy. There was a little boy inside, he had big bug eyes and he also had lazyeyes. so one eye was on the cotton and the other on the unexpected geust. The boy said in a small voice,' yOU WILL FOREVER re-main in this house for life.' All of a sudden The doors and windows dissappeared into nothing and they all; look at each other in puzzlement'. 'What are we going to do?'said bo. I do know?? 'I know i am eating some of this great candy',said danielle. good idea. they all sit and eat the candy. The boy then explains how he got lost one day and found the house and has been stuck in there for the last 12 years. 'wow' 'that is amazing' 'i guess we will be here 4ever then.' yeah. at least we arnt alone. yeah. 'are parents are going to be freaked'. It will be okay i think. 'I love cotton candy'..,saids danielle.

589736,male,Technology,"           Oh, Mir -- it's nice to see that things haven't changed!  As offended as you might be because Lott stepped up at the birthday party of a man who has lived ONE HUNDRED YEARS and said something vaguely nice about his past, I am 300% MORE offended that you have just compared Trent Lott to Adolf Hitler. There're extreme examples and then there are examples that are so extreme as to make them irrelevant. Exhibit A, your response below.  Once my breathing exercises kicked in, I was able to conjure up a response. Here's a counter-example that is a little closer to home: It's Ben's 60th birthday party. We're all gathered around, munching on fried tofu strips and organic vegetables. I raise my glass to my old friend. 'Ben,' I say, 'you've lived a long and fruitful life. We have all watched with a little envy as you have lived a life imagined and been true to yourself. Now, I was sure that Leslie would turn out to be your one true love, and if you'd snapped her up before she turned legal, your life would have certainly turned out differently. You might even have had enough money to afford to retire by now, instead of mooching off us for so long.' [cue polite laugher from the crowd]   Does this mean that I am advocating a romatic relationship between a 28-year-old adult and a 16-year-old minor? Am I coming out in favor of statutory rape? Hardly. What I am doing is speaking some comforting words to a dear friend of mine, trying to get him to reminisce about days gone by and success won and lost. Now, I am deliberately choosing a less extreme example. Segregation is wrong. Slavery is evil. There is no defending the southern white politicians or the white mobs of the 50s and 60s. But Trent Lott was toasting an old man at his BIRTHDAY PARTY, praising his past efforts, trying to make said old man think back on his life and feel content. Instead of a nice comment on an old man's accomplishments, this has exploded into a racial issue -- and the press has been pumping the bellows and tossing the gasoline cans with reckless abandon for 10 days.  Read the direct quote: '''I want to say this about my state,' Lott said at the party. ''When Strom Thurmond ran for president, we voted for him. We're proud of it. And if the rest of the country had followed our lead, we wouldn't have had all these problems over all these years either.''' (Washington Post, 7 Dec 02)  Where in that statement does Lott praise segregation? Where is the racist in the white sheet? Where does he say that the country would be better if we shipped all those dirty negroes back to Africa? Hell, the man didn't even once say 'segregation' -- much less say that the overtly segregationist policies of the Dixiecrat party were right and good and embodied all that made America great. But you wouldn't guess that reading the news stories today....  Now, here's what the press has been reporting for the past two weeks [emphasis added]: 'Senate Republican leader Trent Lott (Miss.) last night apologized for suggesting that the country would have been better off if  segregationist candidate  Strom Thurmond had been elected president in 1948.' (Washington Post, 10 Dec 02); 'Faced with an uproar over his remark that the nation would have been better off if Strom Thurmond had won the presidency  when he ran on a segregationist ticket  in 1948, Senate Republican leader Trent Lott apologized Monday night, saying he misspoke.' (USA Today, 10 Dec 02); 'Republicans are trying to regroup from the uproar caused by the  segregation statement  by Lott, of Mississippi, at an event marking South Carolina Sen. Thurmond's 100th birthday.' (Reuters, 15 Dec 02); '...Lott said Mississippians were proud to have voted for the  one-time segregationist  when he sought the White House.' (AP, 16 Dec 02); '...when Lott  praised the South Carolina Republican's segregationist run for president  in 1948.' (Boston Globe, 19 Dec 02).   And my personal favorite: 'Gore, speaking on CNN's 'Inside Politics,' said the Senate should censure Lott. 'It is not a small thing for one of the half-dozen most prominent political leaders in America to say that our problems are caused by integration and that we should have had a segregationist candidate,' he said. 'That is divisive, and it is divisive along racial lines.'' (AP, 7 Dec 02)  WHERE DID LOTT SAY THAT INTEGRATION CAUSED OUR PROBLEMS????????  What we have here is not a suddenly outed racist. What we have is a feeding frenzy, started by Democrats still stinging from the thorough trouncing they received in the mid-term elections and facilitated, even egged on, by a decidedly liberal press that has already convicted a man of racism. Yet again, I am disgusted by the blatant leftward leaning of our nation's media....          "

589736,male,Technology,"           I will ask you the similar question.  Why would anyone vote  for  John Kerry?  I'm not asking why you hate George Bush, but why should I consider voting for Kerry?  I have not seen many people excited about voting for him.  I have seen plenty of people seething with hatred toward a man who has led us through a recession, terrorist attack, and massive corporate scandals, to the point that the Federal Reserve had to raise interest rates to 'cool down the economy' (on a side note, I never have understood that reasoning).  I know plenty of people who hate him because he says what he believes and he does (or trys to do) what he says.  I asked Ben that question and got the very honest answer that he really wasn't voting for Kerry but against Bush.  I am probably in the same boat, on the opposite side.  I am a conservative.  I am for small government.  I believe that people are the answer to problems, not government.  I am probably more Libertarian than Republican, but until the Libertarians get off the 'legalize pot' argument as their primary campaign issue, I'll have to settle for the Republicans.  Don't misuderstand me, I think pot should be legalized and regualted, but they make a major PR gaff by making that their primary issue.  George Bush has disappointed me in many ways.  He has introduced some radically liberal, big government, social programs that I disagree with.  But, he has many more of my values than John Kerry.  In fact, I think that I only share one value with John Kerry - we both like living/breathing (as versus being dead).  Add to that the fact the he will not make a stand on an issue (i.e. waffling back and forth), then I have no respect for him at all.  I also like the hypocrisy of the talk of the 'Two Americas', considering his wealth and his running mates wealth.             "

3389918,female,indUnk,"       Have you ever read 'The picture of Dorian Gray' by Oscar Wilde? It is an interesting book... here is an interesting bit I just came across, reading today... (I'm rereading the book, haven't read it in years)  ~~'Only when one is young,' she answered. 'When an old woman like myself blushes, it is a very bad sign. Ah! Lord Henry, I wish you would tell me how to become young again.' He thought for a moment. 'Can you remember any great error that you committed in your early days, Duchess?' he asked, looking at her across the table. 'A great many, I fear,' she cried. 'Then commit them over again,' he said gravely. 'To get back one's youth, one has merely to repeat one's follies.' 'A delightful theory!' she exclaimed. 'I must put it into practice.' 'A dangerous theory!' came from Sir Thomas's tight lips. Lady Agatha shook her head, but could not help being amused. Mr. Erskine listened. 'Yes,' he continued, 'that is one of the great secrets of life. Nowadays most people die of a sort of creeping common sense, and discover when it is too late that the only things one never regrets are one's mistakes.' A laugh ran round the table.~~  The only thing one regrets is one's mistakes... Interesting theory. I'm not sure that I agree with that... Maybe, to some degree... But the OTHER theory... To get back one's youth one had merely to repeat one's follies... That is very true... So many people tell me that I look and act so much younger than I am, but the acting young is what promotes the looking young... Other people my age think that now that they are a 'certain age' they have to act a 'certain way'... That is what makes people old... old is an attitude, not an age... I can think of lots of 'follies' from my youth I would love to repeat... and do so on every available occasion....lol         "

Yesterday night was a movie marathon as I spent a couple hours under the star-less, cloudy sky at the Royal Botanic Gardens, watching Y Tu Mama Tambien as part of the Moonlight Cinema festival. The festival runs for about 3 1/2 months till mid March, with screenings of shows like Grease, or Frida or My Big Fat Greek Wedding - basically an eclectic mix of shows, and even Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers as the festival closer.  Following the nice picnic under the star-less, cloudy sky at the Royal Botanic Gardens, EG and I joined Charles, Alan and Shawn watching double-o-seven on the big screen at 12.45 am - explosions and diamonds for everybody!

883178,male,Fashion,"            Once I was out with DJS  By Duf Fer  Lost my login info, but just found it.  What's new?  Here's a blog for my peeps.  Once I was out with DJS and he said that someday, when he has a little critter [or little critters] of his own, he would not mind waking up in the middle of the night for feedings and gentle rockings to sleep.  This is my prayer for  DJS:  that he never actually has to test that statement.  My prayer is that he will have a child [or childrens] that sleeps [be sleepin'] through the night because friends, I am so tired today, my whole body hurts.  Here's how it happened:  TinyE (the pride and joy of Duf and Mrs. Duf), who can now crawl out of her crib,  went to bed around 8:30 .  Duf and Mrs. Duf went to  bed at 11:00 .    Mrs. Duf was reading a thriller by a Scandanavian author who puts the 'er' in thriller.  Duf was working one a poem about elevation from disgrace and despair through the enjoyment of a near perfect plum.    Anyway,  at 1:30 , TinyE woke up and came walking into the marital bedroom where nothing much was going on but a bit of the old in out, in out (known Chez Duf Fer (pronounced 'doo fair') as inhaling and exhaling, also know as catching flies, also known as snoring (for those of you who misunderstood me to reference that wonderful 70s icon  A Clockwork Orange )).  Anyhow, TinyE woke us up, and Mrs. Duf, who does most of the heavy lifting on the graveyard shift (and otherwise) coaxed her back to sleep.    PumpkinCountryBumpkin (also known as TinyE)  woke again at 3:00  and DadDuf did  not get her back to sleep until 3:30 .     At 5:00 , she woke up, and she was done for the night.  I needed her to go  at least until 8:00 .  I  would have taken 7:00 .  I'll admit that  6:00  would not have lead to a blog, but would have allowed for some gripin'.   But 5:00 ?

4187809,female,Communications-Media,"             I was talking to a friend of mine yesterday, and we had a really interesting conversation. He was telling me about this prayer that he's been praying lately...  to ask God to give all the young adults everything they ever wanted... monetary success, relationships, the lifestyle that they want... everything... but in ONE aspect... where God is supposed to be; one   BIG FAT ZERO  .   So I asked him, what were other people's responses to his prayer?  He said, someone told him... 'hey, what kind of prayer is that!?'  Hmm.. what kind indeed... it really gave me something to think about, because in reality, i know a lot of young adults (especially in the church... myself included!) are seeking for something more in life.. it's like we're never contented... always looking for something more.. more fun, more money, etc..  And yet, there is an undeniable cry from within our hearts for something more meaningful. Something that looks like a God-shaped hole.  I woke up this morning thinking about this, and telling God, ' I don't ever want to have an empty bank account with you!'  (spiritually, i mean, duh! :)  It has been my heart's cry to ask God to fill it... fill it with His presence. And yet, a lot of times, it just seems to elude me. Is this a route that God wants me to take? To just   trust  . Not to rely on my feelings. I have this disatisfaction within me, and part of me thinks it's somekind of holy disatisfaction... to always want to have more of God. That's good, isn't it?  But I can't say that I've  never  experienced God's presence in my life. Many times, He has reassured me by just a gentle nudge in my spirit, about an issue in my life... or something that I should be doing. Or just spoken to me thru His Word.  Could it be then, that    my listening channel has somehow been corrupted?        By something in my life that is blocking my sensitivity to Him... Or is it just the fact that I've stopped listening?  All I know is that I never want to stop seeking Him. And i don't want a big fat zero where God is.                "

Anyhoo, I've got a few things on my mind and I often stop to think and reflect about the things that I have seen, experienced and hope for the future. I've always been a 'heavy thinker' so much so that my mom told me when I was young that one day I might grow up to have an ulcer. (All right! Something to look forward to!) I had a very 'heavy thinking' week this past week. I get bogged down with people's expectations of me, my expectations of others, and my fears and insecurities. I've realized that this isn't a good time. I don't want to think about those things so much anymore. This is easier said than done, but I'm trying. Take a deep breath, trust in God and just let it go.   Sorry to get a little heavy on you, but I feel better. Thanks.  And on to the F5:  1. What do you most want to be remembered for?   I think being a kind, loyal soul would be nice. Oh and the effing hot chic bass playah this town has evah seen...rock.   2. What quotation best fits your outlook on life?   At this moment: don't worry, be happy.    3. What single achievement are you most proud of in the past year?   Moving past bad relationship moments and finding joy in loving someone.    4. What about the past ten years?   Oof...there are a lot of big and small victories over the past 10 years, can't point out just one. I would say the most meaningful moments have come from relationships - finding love, enduring love, losing love and starting all over again. It's humbling and empowering in the same minute.   5. If you were asked to give a child a single piece of advice to guide them through life, what would you say?   Don't be afraid to jump in with both feet.

I don't care though, I just want to be happy but even the things that make me happy, like lacrosse, are starting to piss me off. I just want to crawl up in a ball right now and hide away for the rest of the year.  I just have to think about how things will get much better after this week and the next. But even so, after that then I realized how shit my grades out and still will freak for the rest of the year, joy. All I know is that I don't have time for anything, and ya I just want to stop doing everything.   All I want is for something to happen and someone to do something maybe a little out of their way to make me happy, even if they dont' have to go out of their way, just to care and try to make me happy is all I'm asking. I don't care about how much I bitch about stuff when other people have the same amount of work if not more than me, but this is how I handle things and this is how I am. I'm not the smartest, I can't take tests, and that's just how I am so then I freak out even more about school. People just need to understand that and just realize that even if whatever I'm doing may not be that tough to them or seem that significant and complainable to them, it is to me. It really is. I know I'll be fine after this year and after this week and the next, but it doesn't hurt to try to help at the moment and the time even if in the long run it'll get better no matter what. Just that one happy moment can change your attitude about everything and help a lot more.   Urgh, I'm done, I'm just sick of this shit, I really am.

3835942,male,indUnk,"           Last weekend turned out to be another memorable weekend for me.  I thought that I have exhausted Paris and there's nothing more to see in it. I am grateful for Marc, who explained about the places to see in Paris and made me realize that I had barely seen Paris and there's a lot to be discovered and who guided to me to a bookstore in La Defense where I bought a guide. I had to start my sight-seeing almost from the scratch to be comprehensive.  So this week my plan was to cover: 1.Ile de la Cite 2.The Marais 3.Beauborg and Les Halles 4.Tuileries Quarter. But I couldn’t go to the last one for want of time.  It seems that every week I had to start with a church! So now it was St.Chapelle. The church, even though not as huge as Notre Dame, was quite impressive in its architecture. It had two chapels on 2 stages. The lower one was meant for the commons and the upper one seems to have been used by the kings. The lower chapel wasn’t quite attractive except for its roof which had many arches and was in a bright blue colour. A narrow circular staircase led to the upper chapel. Wow! It was so colourful and full of stained-glass paintings. But the tourists who were quite large in number made a hell lot of noise and the building reverberated it to my annoyance! I tried to take a good picture of the rose-window which depicts the scenes from old and new testaments. But my camera's zoom wasn’t good enough. One of the faces of the apostles there attracted me a lot with the calm in its face, carved so beautifully! You have to believe in something or the other to attain that calm or else you'll be pushed into eternal chaos and void. I would like to have a hairstyle and beard like that. If not for the damn tourists' noise I would have sat there for much more time. Felt that the environment was very good to sit and contemplate on something.  The marche aux fleurs et oiseaux (market of flowers and birds) was quite a treat for the eyes. It seems that the island was once famous for its flower markets and this is one of the very few left! There was a shop beside this for decorative items. The items were so beautiful that I wanted to build a house just to host them there!  Then I went through Rue de Arcole  which was full of souvenir shops to reach Notre Dame church. There were a few places there which I had missed earlier. Those are the point zero mark - from where all the distances within France are measured and crypte archeologique underneath which there are relics which are almost 2000 years old.I was looking for the statues of Gargoyles (chimeras) when I had been there before and found them now atop the walls of Notre Dame. Again my camera zoom was not powerful enough to capture them in close-up.  The woman who was in charge of the public toilet of Notre Dame church affected me a bit. She had quite a pleasant smile on her face always and she looked like an Indian. She was guiding the people to a free-cabin in the toilet. I thought nobody could have a passion for such a job and still she manages a smile.  Every street in Paris has a historic lusture. I was amazed to see a street sign on Rue de Francois-Bourgeois which pointed to 3 museums in 3 directions. Thought that one day or the other the residents of Paris will be evacuated for want of place for hosting the museums. So many of them.  I cannot forget Musee Picasso for the rest of my life for the impact it had had on me. I was quite half-hearted when I paid and entered the museum. But slowly I began to realize the genius of Picasso. It was so intense that it could pierce my ignorance of art. Mind-blowing imagination. Until then, my perspective of art and painting was that its just drawing portraits and landscapes and caricatures and theres no intelligence or analytical thinking involved in it. But many of the paintings that I could comprehend made me realize that I was egregious to an abysmal  extent. At first many of the paintings are quite inscrutable. I read the placards placed in front of each of the rooms explaining the importance of the exhibits and the phase of life of Picasso in which he drew them. Combined with a bit of imagination and absurdity, slowly I could decipher a few of them and those had a profound impact on me. What if I could understand everything? I would go mad! I used to think that only symmetry in objects and paintings would be beautiful. For once and forever I realized total incongruity can also be beautiful insofar as they depict the concept handled by the artist and the depth of it. I could see that at the start as an artist he too was drawing normal pictures and as he aged he paintings involved more and more abstraction. And also the subjects of the paintings like bull-fight, war, romance, sex, illness, death et al reflect the agony of their creator. And it was quite interesting to know that his wife ran away from him. Not surprising. They say that theres a woman behind every man's success. They forgot to add that he has to overcome that woman too to attain that success! They turn the simple task of life to an herculean one!  I was very much affected by a bronze piece of skull sculpted by him which reminded me of my mother's skull. Its still fresh in my memory and would be there till my head turns to one. The works which depicted illness, death, gruel war with dark and dull colours and which depict the frailty and ephemerality of life invoked sadness in me. Death is a subject which I am grappling with for quite sometime now and its unfathomable and quite disquieting! I believe that instead of trying to understand life by attacking it directly, I might get some light if I approach it by trying to comprehend its absence, death. They are two sides of the same coin. One inevitably leads to the other!  After going through most of his works and a bit of his biography I was wondering how could this world understand his complex conceptual works and allow him to rise to prominence. He is a genius inasmuch as he found a language to express his emotions. I was very much amused to see a group of little girls debating which leg belonged to which face in a painting and an elderly girl trying to guide them and make them realize the picture. I am ashamed of my ignorance of art.  Another part of the museum had his sculptures. They were works of a creative genius in Picasso. I've read about the bull-head created with a bicycle-seat and handlebar. To see that and to see many others like a goat's stomach made of a waste basket and a child in a trolley made out of iron pipes and pots was quite intriguing. It takes a genius to bring simplicity in chaos. This is exactly my state of mind - utter chaos and I am afraid I do not have the intelligence to discern the simple and eternal concepts behind them which runs this universe.  One more reason why I was annoyed with myself is my ignorance of the meaning of colours. If only I had that knowledge, I could fathom much more of Picasso. My heart and mind was full with pleasure when I came out of the museum for the only reason that I had discovered another language of expression. Quite a treat!   Then I went to the garden in Places des Vosges. Its beautiful with the surrounding buildings. There were lots of children playing there. And there were a group of violinists playing at a corner. There was a rush to hear to them. I envied those children very much. There's so much of art, music, poetry around and surely many of them would grow up as artists, poets, philosophers and musicians. No seed in a child would die of starvation of imagination and expression. Its a very appealing ambience.  In 6,Places des Vosges is Maison de (house of) Victor Hugo. There were a lot of paintings of his and the manuscripts and old posters of his shows were on exhibit inside. I didn’t know that he could paint. Everybody seems to have some knowledge of art and music. Its very bad that I didn’t study them. But many of the paintings depicted poverty and illness and other somber subjects. I didn’t quite like them. I would have appreciated if he had depicted glory and heroism. I equate him to those qualities. But it felt good to visit that house where its said that he wrote most part of Les Miserables.  The whole of the next day I spent in the beauborg district with most of the time in Musee National d'Art Moderne in the Pompidou centre. I started my tour at the Pompidou centre. Its strikingly different than any other building I would ever see. In short its a building built inside out. All kinds of pipes, elevators, escalators are outside the building! The pipes outside the building were coloured distinctively to symbolize their function like ventilation, water, air-conditioning, electricity etc. The escalator which takes us to all the floors was set up across the facade of the building which was quite an attraction. At first, I was not interested in the modern art museum. But I could go to the top of the building only if I take a ticket to the museum! So I dropped the idea of going there to the top to take pictures. The centre hosts a cinema complex - playing kind of art pictures. And from 19March to 17April its Bollywood special! They were playing chaiyya chaiyya song in a TV and then I heard the Hindi version of a song from the Tamil film Kandukondein Kandukondein! In the library there dedicated to art and industrial design I was amazed to see a book on Indian films with Simran on its cover. And there was a book on photography which was dedicated to human genitals! Really crazy!  Beauborg district is very small but its very beautiful. Last time I've been to the wrong part of it and thats why I felt that it wasnt the most picturesque. Place Igor Stravinsky, very near to the pompidou centre, has a lot of so-called modern fountains which were quite funny to look at. They seemed not to have been maintained well. Many werent working properly. But the place looked colourful.  Besides this place, there's St.Merry church. I went inside to see the old 13th century pulpit. The church was quite small. Many churches here have the look of Notre Dame.  Then I went to Fountain des Innocents and Forum les Halles. Forum les Halles is quite intriguing in that it has a garden at the ground floor and a big shopping complex, cinema complex , swimming pool, gymnasium in the floors below the garden! The building which surrounded the garden was pretty to look at.  After going to all these places, I entered into the Pompidou centre again.Got the ticket for the museum and went to the top!But I was dismayed to see that I could not get out of the closed glass escalators to the terrace or anywhere to take clear pictures.I could only take pictures from inside that glass tube!Then I went to the modern art museum!It turned out to be another lesson for me, like Musee Picasso.  Many paintings were quite indiscernible. The paintings were like scribblings of a kindergarten kid hung in the name of contemporary art! It was quite funny. But I was bemused very much with the works of artists called Cesar, Sigmar Polke(for Pasadena), Andy Warhol (for Electric Chair), Jean Pierre Raynaud(for Container Zero), Opalka (for Details).I could not quite understand container zero and pasadena. I noted all these names and works for investigating a bit on them! I myself felt strange. Many works which involved optical illusion and compression mechanics were also intriguing. Roman Opalka's details is a bit weird. The painting is nothing but a series of numbers. But the importance of it comes from the meaning given to it. Opalka seems to have wanted to do something that would only die with him and uptill then keep on evolving! So he decided to write numbers on a board. He started from 1 and I do not know where he ended. Only part of his work was on display. I could see numbers like 3309916, 5131330 and so on. When he finished one board of numbers he would take a photograph of himself. I think the total work includes a dozen boards. The colour of the board gets lighter and lighter starting from gray. The numbers are in white. So as he gets older, it becomes more and more difficult to read the numbers. What a crazy idea! I was wondering how much he should have been affected by death and the finiteness of life to make him take up this kind of a work.  Another artist that I should mention is Yaacov Agam. His is a fantastic idea. He hated the static nature of art and succeeded in bringing dynamism in it by involving time and motion. They call it kinetic art. A room was dedicated to one of his works. In a room, 3 sides , the floor and the ceiling contain some strange patterns. One side is ofcourse open for us to see! For once I was lost. I thought this is another one that I could not understand even a bit. But the silver ball placed at the centre of the room explained everything and the genius of Yaacov. I saw patterns of circles and diamonds and various other shapes. As you walk from one end of the face of the room to another you see the pattern changing! What a genius! What kind of painstaking imagination! Superb! That was indeed my favourite.  But my body got tired and hungry and I had to leave the centre to my room!  So this week turned out to be a week that awakened me towards art.Picasso and Yaacov Agam have lit the light!  There are abundant languages to express oneself. And I think the best and perfect among them is SILENCE.          "

3931473,female,Science,"             Kevin got an email from the sportswear place asking his salary range.  Although unscrupulous, I intercepted this email via webmail and replied with a 25k-30k requirement, citing that the last job held paid 28k with benefits.  After sending this email, I let it remain in the inbox to be downloaded to his outlook.  As predicted, he saw the email and wanted to respond to it with a 25-30k requirement.  I am good.  So while he was indisposed in the shitter, I made a dummy email that said the same thing and sent it to a dummy email addy.  It was bounced back undeliverable, but I deleted it from the inbox and deleted mail box so he'll never know the difference.  When he came back in from the bathroom, he read the sent copy and was satisfied with the reply.  Not that he should actually send his own stuff.  I made the resume.  I wrote the cover letter.  I found the job.  I applied him for it.  Then he has the audacity to tell me he has to do everything because I ask him to bring me something from the kitchen while he is up and already in the kitchen.  Hmmmm.  He better get this friggin job because I'll be god damned if I have to sell my car so we can get by and I have to drive a junk piece of shit even though I make a ton of money.  Sad, but true, I have to pay for every bill, plus my debt, rent, car payment, vacation fund (which I made a separate one for me) pet costs, food, EVERYTHING.  He even asked if I could use my credit card to buy him toys.  What?  I don't think so asshole.  If I have to do without some things I like, so do you.

589736,male,Technology,"           For the record, I went back and checked the official FEC results of the 2000 election.  If every single vote cast for Nader had been cast for Gore, which is of course extremely arrogant supposition, then yes, Al Gore would be the president of the United States (shudder),  But, it would not have turned into the landslide that Ms. Randi seems to think it would.  Here's a big surprise (tic).  The areas with the most Nader support were areas that Gore won handily.  The only states in which there would have been a different outcome are Florida and New Hampshire.  The revised total would have been 295-242, the closest since Carter-Ford in 1976 (297-240).  That's a far cry from Nixon-McGovern in 1972 (520-17), Reagan-Carter (489-49), Reagan-Mondale (525-13), Bush-Dukakis (426-111), Clinton-Bush (370-168), or Clinton-Dole in 1996 (379-159).  Some interesting tidbits in reviewing the results- Some states do not allow write in candidtates for president (HI, LA, NE, NV, NM, OK, SC, SD) 3,315 people in Nevada cast a vote for 'None of these candidates' 1 Electoral College member from DC abstained instead of casting his vote for Gore as tradition calls for.  I am guessing that it was some kind of protest statement.         "

883178,male,Fashion,"            Because It Feels Like Friday 5    1. How are you planning to spend the summer?  I'm trying to hit every outdoor-seating bar I can this summer.  I'm also attempting to find a new job (not quite as fun or exciting).  [Closed Circuit to the Pandyland crew: I'm looking for a job in Mpls again...cross your fingers.] I will also be moving into a new place in August (if I don't move to Mpls first!).      2. What was your first summer job?  I had a paper route...this lasted about 4 months because I somehow suckered my parents into helping me with it, which completely pissed them off.  If I had to think of my favorite summer job, it was working at the local movie theater. (Popcorn Girl.) I got to see any movie in the city for free, so one summer I saw EVERY SINGLE MOVIE that came out - good or bad.  This also made me very comfortable with going to movies by myself.     3. If you could go anywhere this summer, where would you go?  Like I've said many times before, Iceland.  Or Australia (since it's winter there right now, the weather is mild).  But I can definitely feel another Mpls trip coming....destination: Country Bar.   4. What was your worst vacation ever?  When I was little, my entire family (including grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins) and I would go to Florida for Easter Break.  One year I got so sunburnt I blistered all over...it was pretty gross.  The worst and most painful vacation ever.  Now that I'm older, I can't remember any bad vacations.  I guess I've had good luck (plus, I plan things meticulously so nothing can go wrong...Billygoat on the other hand...don't get me started.)   5. What was your best vacation ever?  I don't know if this was the absolute best, but I had an awesome time when I was with my parents, bro, and sis-in-law in London and Brussels last Thanksgiving.  We got drunk together, laughed a ton, and saw everything we could in 2 fantastic cities.  Plus, I didn't have to pay.  I think the best vacations are free.          "

4192173,male,Technology,"             I have to admit, I have been musically unproductive as of late. That's mostly because of the holidays and everyone is scattered, etc. There was a loose gameplan to try and record some more drums this week. The drummer and I were up for it, but Ash didn't feel comfortable doing it without Brandt, and it might have been more of a hassle than productive. Also, one of Ash's many projects, the glitch-y sounding Carbon Framework, which is quite good, has been picked up by a label and he has to rush some material out for a 12 inch. Congrats Ash!   Meanwhile, the musical behind the scenes always keeps me busy. I had my first Chemlab hissy-fit this week, for reasons I can't reveal, but unlike the aggression, where I treat everything like a soap opera, I tried to not be melodramatic about this. Like every album or band, there have been a few hiccups along the way, some I brush aside, others I tackle full on. In the aggression, I'm the 'boss' so it means juggling 100 different things. In Chemlab, I'm able to focus more on certain things, while Jared, as 'boss' focuses on the many issues. I think my job with Chemlab beyond the music is to give perspective, which is why Mr. Novak suggested my 'quality control' credit on the album. I should give Ash or Brandt one of those on Hypefactor, maybe? (no fuckin' way!)  Sadly, but not life-threatening, Chemlab has been moved back 2 weeks. Usually it's time to blame the label, but this time its Caroline's fault. No surprises there. However, this is locked now. February 10th. I'm happy with today's reaction on the Chemlab site to the song BINARY NATION, which started in this very computer. I think this is one the kids will latch on to when they get the album. Very proud of that song. I've gotta learn to keep my gob shut when the narrow-minded dumbasses spuzz their stupid thoughts on the music on the sites. I feel like the defender of the cause. Well, you can't make everyone happy, I understand this, and I know people aren't going to love everything you do, but for fucks sake state the opinion with some intelligence ONCE. We'll get the point. Douches. However, that's just a small portion of the kids. I've beeen getting a lot of nice and well-thought out feedback from people. Even if they don't like it, I like that they really put their minds to it and gave it a fair shot.  Anyway, the point of all this is that OXIDIZER is now available for pre-order. If you're smart, order it via the Hydrogenbar.com site. I'm hoping to have some copies next week, but Mark Mohtashemi and The Kidd might blow gaskets if I don't give them copies soon.   Speaking of Pre-Orders, Haloblack's THROB is also available for pre-order (see www.thesickcity.com for details). I point this out because the album is being released by my dear friend Gilez over in the UK via his label Armalyte (http://www.armalyte.com/). Gilez has come a long way in the few years I've known him. Introduced to me by jared, Gilez put us on his Defcon 1 compilation and then brought the aggression over to the UK in 2001 for the release show. We've remained friends ever since . He's a helluva guy and a good family man. He works hard and it's good to see him being able to release an album of this calibre. It legitimizes him. Gilez and I spent a significant portion of the day yesterday trading secrets and ideas on how to eventually work together. We even laid out the terms of our deal. This could happen 10 years from now for all I know. It's not going to be Hypefactor, and probably not the aggression. But I know what Gilez wants for his label and it meshes with what I'm feeling like doing post-EXIT STRATEGIES. More on this, much later. MUCH.  Been struggling with the passing of a friend this holiday season, but I woke up this morning to a nice letter from a certain keyboardist in a band I have made no secret of adoring. It was a simple note expressing his appreciation for my support of said band. This started things with a smile, so kudos to the keyboardist in question. Made my day!  Off to LA on Monday. Not going to miss this horribly cold weather. Luckily for irene, she's coming out as well, so she can get away from this too. I'm hoping to have Chemlab copies next week, so I'll report in.

made some hot cocoa...which I hate...but I couldn't seem to get hot...or even a little warm...I kept frozen...so I decided to go out...find another place to stay...maybe at a friends' home or something...so I went out...and then...again.....the cold made my life miserable...the car didn't start...the engine was frozen...same as me.....so I walked...I was staying at a house in the mountains....but not that far away from some friends' place....so I went walking...but I got lost..the road had been covered with snow and I had no idea where to go.....then I heard a noise...it came from the trees...I went there and found a little girl...lost..crying...I tried to talk to her...to hold her so that she wouldn't feel cold...but she went away....well not exactly....she just rejected me...and continued crying..I stayed besides that tree....near to the girl...maybe someone would try and save her...and well...I'd be saved to...but she didn't seem to be looking for anyone....she didn't seem to want to go anywhere...then she calmed down...sat besides me...suddenly she pulled out a knife...but not any kind of knife...It was one of those hunter ones....with all sorts of

decision it has been controlling me...this feeling hasn't left my body..and it will never leave..it needs it....I need it...I'm sorry...believe me I am...but there's just nothing I can do...I was

fulfill its need...for blood... ...at that time I felt some strength coming back...and I was totally confused....What was that girl talking about???.....What was IT???....then I asked her....she looked straight into my eyes....I wanted her to answer fast....fast before I died...she said she couldn't tell me...I begged for an answer...I needed it....all she said was if she told me she couldn't let me die....and I tried to smile...and asked her..again...to tell me.....to please tell me and save my life...but she said it had been because of that intrigue that she was where she now was....lost and trying to escape...she said shed rather let me die...than save my life...so that I didn't have to go through what she was going...but anything felt better that death at that time....and I told her I didn't want to die...she said she had warned me.....but that it had been my choice...and I was going to regret it...very much.....but I didn't care...so she did it...she  *saved*  me.....by making me drink my own blood....it felt disgusting...and everything became silent....I fell asleep...I woke up...at night...again....but I felt no more cold...the night was the same as the one before...but I only felt strong...the cut the little girl had made me...Didn't hurt....at all....it had even healed off....perfectly...in one day....I freaked out...What had she done to me???...What had she turned

eat....while I was /hunting/ I looked into my pockets....there was a knife....same as the one I had been cut with...it was new...well it seemed new...and clean...in perfect condition...it was perfect for what I needed....and I found the perfect victim....a young woman....who's car had broken down...I was looking at her...from in between the trees..and I came out....walked towards her...looking snobbish and interesting....she looked at me and asked for some help..I said I'd help her.....but the need grew stronger....I couldn't even act as if I didn't want to kill her...to eat her...to drink her....so I just took the knife y stuck it into her stomach...she was in pain...same as I had been the night before...but I didn't care...I wasn't like that little girl.....I didn't ask for the woman to forgive me...I just killed her....took her into the woods..and ate her.....drank her blood...feasted on her meat...and fell asleep...I woke up the next morning...even stronger than before....but my conscious wasn't clean...I remebered everything....to the slightest detail....it felt horrible....I had killed and eaten another human being...but I was no longer human...I didn't know what I was...I looked human...but there was something in me that had changed...and now I understand what the little girl had been saying....how I was gonna regret making that decision...and I did..I regret it...too much...now I know what IT was...she was young..and didn't know what she was feeling..she called IT the urge she felt....the need for human flesh and blood...and now there's no way back.....suicide just doesn't work....eating other people makes you stronger.....strong enough not to die...and now I have to live with this....without having the strength to control myself..to end this up....because IT moves me...IT controls me...and I'm not like any other cannibal...there's something more to it...something that cannot be explained...something that's stronger than me and that has taken over me...a dark force...that took the human away...and turned in the beast..

883178,male,Fashion,"            Moses was right, I need to do this -     1. What is the one thing you don't like about your body?  Is there anyone out there who has only one thing they dont like about their body?  Alright, Ill go with my midget-jaw.  Its far too small (or the rest of my face is far too big), and because of that, I dont like my face in profile, at all.    2. What are two things you love about your body?   I finally have an appreciation for my height (for the record, the last time I checked I am somewhere between 510 and 511).  I had a hard time with it in adolescence, but now I dont mind it when people ask me to grab something off the high shelf at Target.  Its also a major foundation of my faith, as when I was a yougn I literally used to pray to God that I would not be 6 tall or taller.  The exception is that Im still not used to the really weird comments (among several odd experiences, Ive had a stranger inform me that Im lucky Im so tall, because no man will lie to me, as he has to look me in the eye) that I get.  Im also a fan of my feet, which explains my shoe and pedicure expense problems.   3. What are three things you want to change about your home?   I dont like many of the people in our building, including, but not limited to:  the freaks across the hall, the loud bastards below us, and the weird, haggard, drifter-type guy who lives somewhere else in the building.  I miss having a garbage shoot like I did in my old building (much more convenient for refuse-removal), and finally, I miss having a garbage disposal (also a convenience in refuse removal).    4. What are four books you want to read this year?   I dont plan that far in advance.  But I would like to finish the 6 or so books that I have partially-read.    5. What are five promises you have kept to yourself?  Wow, Im not nearly that well thought-out.  Nor am I much of a goal-setter.  I have promised myself that I will never drink that much again, but then broken that promise.  I would like to travel to all 50 states in my lifetime (so far, about 30 are down).  It would also be neat to go to each continent (excepting Antarctica).  Ive only done 2 of those.  I better get on that.          "

589736,male,Technology,"           Ahem. Sorry I'm late for the discussion, but I had to clean up the small flood in my basement first. It might not surprise any of you that I have some thoughts about the upcoming conflict and the issues surrounding it.  Let me apologize in advance, as this is going to be long as crap, but bear with me (I've been thinking a lot about these issues lately -- time is about the only thing my  unemployed ass can afford these days).  First, though, I have but one word for the way the Bush Administration has handled foreign policy since the collapse of the Taliban in Afghanistan:   Amateurish . If you don't like that one, here're some other choices: sloppy, slapdash, clumsy, crude, slipshod, inept, bungling, or incompetent.  The Model UN Conference that I attended in 1992 at Princeton would have produced more elegant diplomacy than that of the leadership of the current administration. I have been continuously amazed and dismayed at the ineptitude with which this administration has conducted foreign policy. Bush II sold his soul (with the tacit approval of the Republican National Committee) to the conservatives in 2000 in order to win South Carolina and staunch the grassroots support that was propelling John McCain to the Republican nomination. Woe to the future of our country as a result, for the very same conservatives that now have a hotline to the Oval Office (or perhaps more importantly, to Carl Rove's office) and they are giving our reputation as thorough a drubbing as Clinton did back in 92-93. The ham-handed and despicably snotty attitude with which this administration has approached the rest of the world has directly lead to the worst crisis in NATO history and an intransigent and increasingly hostile UN. I was relieved to see that I wasn't the only one of this opinion last Sunday -- read this article:  Forceful Tactics Catch Up With U.S.  Turns out that the US is only reaping what it was sown over the past 2 years, starting with our disgraceful behavior re: the Kyoto Accord and going downhill from there. (Some of you might remember my support for our withdrawal from the ABM Treaty -- mind you, I still think that we did the right thing -- just in a terribly wrong fashion....)  So, registering my strong, nay intense, disapproval for the manner in which Mr. Bush II conducts his foreign policy, let me now tell you why going to war is not only right, but in the best interests of the US in the long-run: lubing the wheels of regime change in Iraq means the difference between John and Johnathan's nightmarish and ultimately impossible proposal of utterly annihilating all extremists in order to live peacefully, and influencing the world in such a positive manner that extremists will be relegated to John's desert, where they can do little harm.   But first we must set aside all of the emotional and bleeding heart baggage in order to discuss  realpolitik  in a form Cardinal Richelieu would immediately recognize and approve. So, let's set aside the fact that war is destructive and killing people is wrong -- that's a given. Set aside the wrong-headed argument that this is about oil -- 1) unless you are living in a cabin in the wilderness without electricity and  any  modern convenience, you  must  accept the fact that oil is the lifeblood of our modern society and therefore securing a stable and cheap source incontrovertibly benefits all of us; and 2) If oil was on Bush II's mind, we would invade Venezuela, whose crisis has posed a more serious oil problem for the United States than Iraq ever could. Set aside the fact that this whole thing with Iraq feels like 'You beat up on my dad by defying him, so I'm gonna beat up on you...' -- since the hawks of Bush II's administration were all veterans of Bush I, we can assume that that  certainly  had a lot to do with choosing Iraq as the next target after the Taliban folded like a cheap card table. Johnathan, the reason you noticed the link between terrorism and Iraq has been downplayed is because  there isn't one.  Regardless of all of these issues, there are compelling reasons for us to go to war in the desert again.  So let's talk geopolitics: On the day the war ends (and I'm not taking a big leap by assuming that we win), then the  entire geopolitics of the region will be redefined . Every country bordering Iraq will find not the weak formations of the Iraqi army along their frontiers, but US and British troops. We will be able to reach into any country in the region with covert forces based in Iraq, and we could threaten overt interventions as well. We will not need permission from regional hosts for the use of facilities, so long as either Turkey or Kuwait will permit transshipment into Iraq. In short, a U.S. victory will change the entire balance of power in the region, from a situation in which the US must negotiate its way to war, to a situation where we are free to act as we will.   If we consider the post-Iraq war world, it is no surprise that the regional response ranges from publicly opposed/privately not displeased to absolute opposition. Certainly, Syria, Saudi Arabia and Iran (and Jordan, to a lesser extent) have nothing to gain from a war that will be shaped entirely by the United States. Kuwait and Turkey are the other countries bordering Iraq, and they are in the US camp already. Syria, Saudi Arabia and Iran have been banking on European resistance to a war to prevent it. It remains to be seen if that can happen -- personally, I think that Bush II will pull the trigger no matter what the UN decides in the end. And the rest of NATO has already come out in support -- magnifying the split within the European Union between the big nations and the small (Germany and France vs. everyone else). And don't even get me started on my opinions about why France is opposing the war.... The European split -- and the real possibility that France and Germany ultimately will endorse war in some way in order to reap the not insubstantial benefits of rebuilding Iraq -- mean that war cannot be prevented. Saddam will not abdicate or be overthrown until the war is well under way. Therefore, it is highly likely that the war will take place, the US will occupy Iraq, and that the map of the Middle East will change profoundly.  The Bush II administration is well-aware that its increased presence in the region will result in greater hostility. However, we should view this rising cost as acceptable so long as Washington is able to redefine the behavior of countries neighboring Iraq. In the long run, though, geopolitical power will improve US security interests in spite of growing threats. To be more precise, Islamic hostility at a certain level as a given, and does not regard an increase in that hostility as materially affecting its interests.  The conquest of Iraq will not be a minor event in history: It will represent the introduction of a new imperial power to the Middle East and a redefinition of regional geopolitics based on that power. The US will move from being an outside power influencing events through coalitions, to a regional power that is able to operate effectively on its own. Most significant, countries like Saudi Arabia and Syria will be living in a new and quite unpleasant world. And, perhaps more importantly, it will offer the opportunity to create a democratic state in the Middle East that actually works. A place where democracy and capitalism are afforded the opportunity to grow and flourish. And this, more than any other reason, is why it's important for us replace Saddam by any means necessary.   Because this gets down to the root of the issue, as JS has urged us to do.  It comes down to this: Where there is globalization and economic opportunity, John and Johnathan's extremists are forced into the proverbial desert. Where there is economic stagnation and political repression, and the extremists not only operate in the open, but they are a powerful force in that society. So, rebuilding Iraq  a la   Germany after WWII is not only good morality, but it is solid strategic vision.  If you have the chance, get your hand on a copy of the 1 March edition of Esquire Magazine. Inside, you will find an article written by Thomas Barnett entitled: 'The Pentagon's New Map. It Explains Why We're Going To War, And Why We'll Keep Going To War.' If you cannot find this article, I have an electronic version I will be glad to email you. It is very important that everyone reads and understands this new paradigm -- remember that the world is an inherently more dangerous place since the end of the Cold War, and this theory goes a long, long way to help us to understand the situation in the world and our place in it. Here are the first couple of paragraphs, which mirror my thoughts exactly:  'Let me tell you why military engagement with Saddam Husseins regime in Baghdad is not only necessary and inevitable, but good.   When the United States finally goes to war again in the Persian Gulf, it will not constitute a settling of old scores, or just an enforced disarmament of illegal weapons, or a distraction in the war on terror. Our next war in the Gulf will mark a historical tipping point the moment when Washington takes real ownership of strategic security in the age of globalization.   That is why the public debate about this war has been so important: It forces Americans to come to terms with I believe is the new security paradigm that shapes this age, namely, Disconnectedness defines danger. Saddam Husseins outlaw regime is dangerously disconnected from the globalizing world, from its rule sets, its norms, and all the ties that bind countries together in mutually assured dependence.   The problem with most discussion of globalization is that too many experts treat it as a binary outcome: Either it is great and sweeping the planet, or it is horrid and failing humanity everywhere. Neither view really works, because globalization as a historical process is simply too big and too complex for such summary judgments. Instead, this  new world must be defined by where globalization has truly taken root and where it has not.    Show me where globalization is thick with network connectivity, financial transactions, liberal media flows, and collective security, and I will show you regions featuring stable governments, rising standards of living, and more deaths by suicide than murder. These parts of the world I call the Functioning Core, or Core. But show me where  globalization is thinning or just plain absent, and I will show you regions plagued by politically repressive regimes, widespread poverty and disease, routine mass murder, and most important the chronic conflicts that incubate the next generation of global terrorists. These parts of the world I call the Non-Integrating Gap, or Gap.'  Let me know if anyone wants to read the rest of this article  its incredibly enlightening.  So  JS and John  it doesnt have to come down to either/or.          "

Bjork:  a musical genius.  Is her stuff as catchy as U2's?  No, nor does it need to be.  With every song she's ever recorded, she comes up with a completely distinct and different sound than her previous efforts.  As for the easy cheap shot EVERYONE makes about the swan dress, here's what I have to say: How dare she wear anything other than Prada or a Bob Mackie dress?  This was the   OSCARS   we're talking about!  Ugh!  On a red carpet full of people spinning around to show off their $50,000 dollar dresses that designers gave to them to wear, Bjork showed up in a dress her friend made and was pretty funny about it.  Of course, she didn't expect the backlash she got from the press and every other automoton that watched the awards.  Her response to it all?  She wore it again (how dare she!) on the cover of her album 'Vespertine.'  Tre cool in my book.  Okay...I can see this escalating in an all-out Pandyland brawl.  For the record, I like some of U2's music and I actually think Bono is okay.  I merely pointed out what I thought was a very corny little statement on his part.  I appreciate what he's trying to do, but he needs to stop acting like he's Jesus Christ with his prophetic words of wisdom.  All in all, it's hard to call Bono an artist.  He's a guy with a microphone and an agenda.         "

Bono: a man with a smoldering, sexy voice, who despite his age makes leather pants look like the best idea ever.   Bjork: a woman with a voice that is alternately shrieky and raspy, who despite common sense once wore a stuffed swan dress.  So which 'artist' is superior? Hmmm...it's such a tough call...         "

3869393,female,Technology,"       Some employers seem to go out of their way to lose the best employees they have. It is always the best employees who leave first as they have the most options. The employer is left with the least talented, least creative employees, the folks reluctant to take risks.  So how do employers accomplish this sort of an exodus?  * Hire your friends and family. This makes it clear to all employees that there is not an even playing field. Get close to the boss...and advancement is yours. It creates a climate of favoritism and brown nosing, which results in management being told what they want to hear. HINT: Any family or friends that are employed should not have a direct reporting relationship. They should compete like anyone else for the job and advancement.  * Don't allow any flexibility. In employee surveys, flexibility in schedules and time off are identified as more important than wages. Caught between raising children and caring for elderly parents, today's employees are sandwiched between conflicting demands. HINT: Make flexibility a priority. Focus on supporting the employee rather than policing the policies.  * Don't replace employees that leave...simply spread the work among remaining staff. Think of the immediate cost savings while staff becomes demoralized. People want to feel successful at work, not set up for failure. HINT: It takes years to undo a negative perception as an employer. Do not sacrifice employee retention for short-term gain.  * Compare staff members. Whether publicly or privately, comparison means someone always comes up short. Comparisons tend to demoralize and discourage and promote competition rather than cooperation. Cooperation is essential to build teams and create a learning organization. HINT: Never compliment one person at the expense of another. Don't engage in workplace gossip.  * Use praise instead of encouragement. What's the difference? PLENTY. Praise is given for a job completed. A job well done. Encouragement is given for effort or improvement. The problem with praise is it is often given only to those who need it the least. While there can be rewards for stellar performance, in a learning organization, more attention should be given to efforts across the organization. HINT: Establish systems that reward efforts and new ideas with a focus on improvement.  * Micro-manage all staff activities. Few things disempower staff like a boss who hovers over their shoulders questioning every move and managing each decision. The message is clear-'I have no confidence in your abilities.' Staff feels discouraged and loses creativity. It is important to remember that there is more than one right way to do things. HINT: Hire good people, and then get out of their way.  * Leave job descriptions vague and uncertain. Similar to embarking on a major journey without a map, expecting great performance by 'winging it' doesn't work. People tend to live up to the expectations given to them. HINT: Make job descriptions detailed and specific. Meet regularly with staff to discuss progress and encourage improvement.  * Give feedback only when there is a problem. The employee learns quickly that there is little recognition of what they do 'right.' The boss will be viewed as nitpicking and critical when they hear only the negatives. HINT: Meet with employees regularly to give positive feedback and encourage improvement.To keep the best employees in today's job market, the employee must be treated as a key customer. Make employee retention and development a top priority.     "

So after two days of ingesting my little pink friends, I was feeling&nbsp;rather proud of myself for feeling absolutely nothing out of the ordinary. Until yesterday afternoon. At around 4:00 I felt a slight twinge in my forehead, which gradually developed into a full-blown, jackhammer-through-my-temples headache.  &nbsp; When bedtime came around my head was still pounding, so I decided to do a bit of yoga to get centered and relax it into submission. I was about 10 minutes into my practice doing a forward bend (and I must say, a pretty&nbsp;good one too,&nbsp;with my chest flat against my legs and my head gently stretching towards the floor)&nbsp;when all of a&nbsp;sudden I was wrenched out of my peaceful zen-like state by a spasm in my esophagus.&nbsp;Before I could&nbsp;utter a single 'om,' I was watching the contents of my dinner&nbsp;plummet towards&nbsp;my sticky mat.  &nbsp; Now, I know it's normal to feel nauseous while practicing yoga.

Yes, he brought her to the party, after all she pays for everything he does and has, so she may as well come along.  I was very surprised at how soothing chanting can be.  'OM' helped me through the day, and eventually I just forgot about her and had a great time anyway.  I would like to think that my apparent ease and comfort at the party really bugged her.  I still have some work to do on digging out my little anger seed in regards to those two.  I didn't sleep well last night, but it had nothing to do with that.  The party exhausted me - it really was a fun day - and so I should have been able to sleep.  I was doing pretty good until 4am when something shattered downstairs.  Sounded like a plate-glass window was completely shattered.  The noise startled me out of a pretty good sleep, and then the train passed by, and soon every little bump, shuffle, and sigh kept me awake.   Around 5:30 I considered getting out of bed, but decided to give it another try.  I was really close to sleep when the train passed again - it does so every half hour starting at 4:30am.  I did finally get back to sleep, just in time to get up.    I almost cried this morning when I heard on the radio that the Metrorail will begin 24-hour service in June.  Diva out.           "

Especially when I have no one to talk to, and I'm just stuck thinking about it forever. That's never a good thing.  I just don't know. I don't think I wanna know. Please don't tell me it's because I'm 'emo'. I've hurd enough of that to last me a lifetime and then some.  I'm going to bed. Track meet tomarrow morning @ 7:30 a.m. See you there.    "

2844168,female,Marketing,"                  A wakeup call that came WAY to early!   Thursdays are always a fun day. I usually have Bible studies with the ladies in the morning, but it's spring break week so we're takin the week off. Then in the evenings we have Life Group, which is always a blast. But this morning began WAY to early!  If you remember I mentioned a couple blogs ago about Sadie and her shiny, fuzzy balls that she kicks around like soccer balls and is ALWAYS losing under the t.v., behind the bookcase, under the couch. Well  very  early this morning she apparently lost one behind the metal filing cabinet in our bedroom. It's 4:45 a.m. and we are rudely awakened by 'thud, thud, thud' as she begins to paw at the filing cabinet in an attempt to get the ball out. And on and on it went until I dragged myself out of bed and sprayed her with the handy squirt bottle we keep nearby for such occasions. Five minutes later just as I'm drifting off to sleep again 'thud, thud, thud.' I spray her again and this went on several times until we somehow in our sleepy state managed to kick her out of the room and shut the door. Then she pawed at the door to get back in until she realized that wasn't going to happen! I tell ya, she wasn't so cute anymore!  So tonight we had Life Group and we're going through a six week marriage study on conflict. I confess, for a variety of reasons, Ked and I were  really  dragging our feet into this study, (and we were facilitating tonight!) It's not that we're perfect, but conflict has never really been a big issue for us. We both have always put a lot of effort into communicating with each other and over the years we've developed a very transparent relationship. Transparency (our topic for tonight) is something we both value and it flows rather freely in our relationship. We also have trouble with studies (such as this one) that list 'these are the four steps to be transparent!' That's a discussion for another time. So, although this study isn't where we're at and was kind of a lot of 'blah, blah, blah' for us, we prayed that we wouldn't let that show and that God might somehow use us. We know that it will most likely meet others in the group where they are and we want to be a helpful part of that process, not a hindrance. As always, the evening was enjoyable, full of stimulating conversation and thoughtful input, and I can honestly say we thoroughly enjoyed the lesson and gained insight from the others in the group. We have a great group of couples who always inject humor and honesty into the discussions. So, despite the dragging of our own feet, I think it turned out well, and we are looking forward to the rest of the study.  Wise, insightful, poetic...not necessarily true, but I like it, oh mighty Falcon!               "

Spent last Wed to Sun morning in Tasmania, with Charles, E-Gene and my sis Tessa. It was a fantastic getaway, seeing the sights, and generally spending a wonderful time with my sis. Really enjoyed it (I should put up some photos...)  School's starting next week though, which is kinda a drag - where did all the good times go? Plus I'm still on the hunt for a job, which I can't seem to get unless I confirm my timetable. Well, we'll see what happens. This semester promises to be pretty exhausting.  On another note, Mac is gonna start charging me to use the email account and all the other nifty features it has, like iDisk and Homepage. I don't use much of it I guess - mostly just the email account, which is forwarded from my school account anyways. It's just 'coz there's the benefit of having a POP or IMAP account, which means I can d/l me mails. Darn, really dun wanna pay the $$ for it - it's US$99.95 a year, but I get a discount for the first year, so it's $49.95. But it's STILL in US dollars...ack....  Going to Chadstone ('the largest shopping mall in the Southern Hemisphere') and Mt. Dandenong tomorrow. Excited about Ms Marples...this cool English tea place that features, u guessed it, Agatha Christie's Ms Marples character, as it's central character.  Am trying to revamp my blog somewhat  - add in cool stuff, like piccies and I dunno, interesting stuff I guess. Good that Tess is around, so she can help me.   I woke up today with the intention of arriving at 9am in school to help the newbies with enrolment. Guess what time I arrived? 10.45am. Woohoo, that has gotta be a record. In the end, they didn't really need much help, so i just mooshed around, chatting, gossiping, discussing last night's SATC and Buffy episodes (btw, the 2 ep. finale was on tonight - Willow vs Buffy...wooo...scary...to the uninformed, Tara, Willow's gf got shot accidentally and Willow's on this kill-the-world-so-I-feel-better-but-end-up-hurting-myself-and-the-people-I-love rampage.

First of all, don't suggest, REQUIRE that all Americans in Saudi leave the country.  Secondly, what we should do THIS MINUTE is take every captive that the terrorists were demaning be released before they beheaded Paul Johnson and behead them.

I adore it...and I have recently stopped hiding it because I don't care who knows that I LOVE celebrity gossip.  When I have to go the brain-fulfilling route, I would say I enjoy Smithsonian (loved the Frida article a few months back), Business 2.0 (esp. nice for a young-professional techie like myself), FastCompany (progressive business-speak), and Entrepreneur (to keep my dream of someday owning my own business alive).  For music, I can't get enough of Q Magazine, although, since it's imported from the UK, the price is high and you can't get the special attached CDs cuz they get lost when shipped over.   2. What is your favorite television station?  I be like Duf...no cable in my humble home.  So I must resort to the more mundane network and local stations.  I really like Public Television (channel 11) on a Saturday afternoon, esp. when they show the entire Anne of Green Gables series.  The WB is something I'm embarrassed to say I enjoy from time to time.  I'm missing the last episode ever of Dawson's Creek tonight, and I forgot to set my VCR, so I'm really bummed (I like me some Pacey, baby.)  Right after work I turn on UPN (channel 10) and watch Blind Date (makes me feel REALLY GOOD about my dating life), and then switch to Fox at 6:30 to watch Seinfeld.  Wow, this sounds like I'm anti-network, which is probably true.  Who in the hell could watch yet  another  episode of Fear Factor or Survivor anyway?  If I had cable, my favorite station would be TLC...hands down.  And maybe Lifetime for the Golden Girls reruns.  Don't get me started again about Bea Arthur.          "

589736,male,Technology,"           Let's get the record straight about the 2000 Election.  After each recount Bush still won in Florida.  I believe there were 3 recounts: a machine recount, and 2 hand recounts.  At the conclusion of each one, the Gore team (not Bush) cried foul and appealed to the higher courts.  It was the Gore team that tried and succeded in a lot of cases to have military absentee votes invalidated because of technicalities.  And they cheered when the decision by the court was returned in their favor!  Can you believe that?!  A candidate who consistently said he wanted 'to be sure that each vote was counted' had his attourneys in court cheering when they discredited the validity of the votes of men and women serving their country!  What a 'man' Gore is!     Next, there  is  federal election law provided in the Constitution.  The Constitution provides the boundaries for electing the President by the electors of the Electoral College.  Check out this web site for more info:   http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/refpages/refarticle.aspx?refid=761576768               'The electoral system was devised by the drafters of the Constitution of the United States, who hoped thereby to entrust the responsibility to people whose choice would be unaffected by partisan politics. In Article II, Section 1, of the Constitution, the method of selecting electors is delegated to the separate state legislatures, and the voting procedure to be followed by the electors is carefully defined. According to the electoral procedure originally specified in the Constitution, the electors were to vote for the two most qualified persons without specifying which was preferred for president and which for vice president. The candidate receiving the greatest number of electoral votes, provided the votes of a majority of the electors were received, would be president, and the candidate winning the second largest number of votes would be vice president. A serious flaw in this procedure was revealed in the election of 1800, when Thomas Jefferson was the presidential candidate of the Democratic-Republican Party (the forerunner of todays Democratic Party) and Aaron Burr was the candidate for vice president. The electors, by voting strictly for candidates of their party, gave Burr and Jefferson the same number of votes. As the Constitution provided, the election was referred to the House of Representatives, where a protracted struggle took place, requiring 36 ballots before Jefferson was chosen president and Burr vice president. Therefore, in 1804 Congress enacted and the states ratified the 12th Amendment, providing for separate electoral votes for president and for vice president.'   As you see in the article, the selecting of electors is left to the states' legislatures, but the election of a President is outlined in the Constitution.  Ben, the author of your article didn't do his homework.  The election of Bush to office according to the Constitution is fully legit.  Sorry, Democrats!   As far as the Toricelli case, Representatives and Senators are elected according to individual laws of the states.  So I can understand why the Supreme Court refused to hear the case.         "

3869393,female,Technology,"       Today I did a little research on what makes a relationship tick....  1.  Trust : Without this there is nothing called a relation between two people. Trust emcompasses 'us'.  2.  Belief : This is not blind belief but a belief which comes out of understanding the person to the extent that there should not be a reason for the other partner to even wonder if there is an underlying meaning to something and takes things at face value.  3.  Ego : If there is an ego in any relationship between two people, only one thing can be a sure thing in this....the relationship is heading straight down the drain.  In a relationship, the mere thought of an ego cannot exist and one needs to bare their soul to the other person.  One can never think in terms of 'I', every thought has to be 'us' or 'we'!  4.  Boundaries : Boundaries fix the end point of your relationship.  Love is boundless, so by putting a boundary for the same or a timeline, one would be curtailing their feelings and allowing time to take a precedence over love.  5.  Past : Past plays a very important role in any relationship.  One needs to make peace with their past before moving to any other relationship.  Without accepting one's past, one always carries the baggage forward and messed the forthcoming relationships.  Then comes the comparision factor, which wrecks any relationship.  Each case is as unique as a finger print.  Comparision will only bring to light the strains of the past.  6.  Time out/ Breaks : This can be a plus as well as a minus in a relationship.  Minus in the sense that people make misuse this time to check out other options and then take a call on the current relationship.  This in reality does not help, but infact confuses the situation and adds a new dimension to ones' already confused mind and soul!  The plus of taking a break/ break, allows one to take a step back and understand the beauty of the relationship.  One never understands the beauty of a relationship while in it, its only when one takes a step back/ out and looks at things from an outsider perspective does one feel ready to accept the pitfalls and the compromises both partners have made towards the relationship.  7.  Coaching : As strange as it may sound, coaching is an essential part of a relationship.  Without the process of continous learning in the relationship, the excitement in the relationship is lost and what one has is just two people trying to cling onto each other because they are not prepared to let go and give each other space to understand themselves and their partner.  Coaching becomes extremely important in a relationship especially when the relationship is moving through a period of turbulence.  It is in period of turbulence that one should not take a decision to step away from the situation, but instead try to guide the other person to the shores close by.  This process of marooning a person in the time of need, infact turns out to be the first steps of moving away from the partner. The relationship needs to be given the time and space to grow, after all its' like a baby which needs to sit up, then have a steady head, then turn over, then crawl, stand, walk, etc.  Each step has an unique joy and moving thro' each level is what brings the two people together.  8.  Anger & Aggression : When one is trying to work towards building a relationship, being aggressive and trying to force an issue will never help.  There is a saying, 'time and tide waits for none', exactly on those lines, when one tries to shift gears in a relationship before it is ready to move to the next level, the relationship heads no where, and infact move down a gear in reality.  Controlled aggression is the way to building a relationship.  Anger will never help in exhausting the pain, its only sweet words or atleast words said in a diplomatic manner which will help.  A person blinded by anger never gets to understand the true meaning of ones' thoughts, and as result never conveys the meaning which is actually intended.  As a result, all the good thoughts and intentions, goes down the drain!  9.  Commitment & Consistency : This is an important key to unlock the box of happiness in any relationship.  Once this is broken, there is not a locksmith in the world which can find a key to match that particular lock.  Unflinching commitment, even in the worst of the circumstances is what gives belief to one's partner and more than anything makes one's partner actually show more love and affection towards them.  One has to stay consistent in a relationship.  In a relationship between two people where there is no blood relationship, its the words and actions which bind the two people together.   Words and actions once executed will always leave their scars on a relationship, atleast in the subconscious mind.  10.  Respect : The most important aspect of any relationship is the respect which the concerned have for each other.  Respect governs the heart and soul. Respect is the corner stone, once lost, takes a very long time to be earned!  I personally believe that relationship between two people who are not connected by a blood relationship is always a fragile one.  Without a good understanding of ones' partner on a deeper and not superficial level, the relationship has no binding at all.    Any building needs a strong foundation......no use of having the strongest pillars, best of the concrete, best of the architectural designs.......reinforcements will never help!           "
2844168,female,Marketing,"                 Wow! What a fun day! I feel so much better after sleeping in today. My brother Jason and his girlfriend Shayna and my cousin Ben all come up today and are spending the night here at Mom & Dad's. What a crazy bunch (and that includes my parents!) We went out for a Mexican lunch and then Shayna insisted that we go to Maggie Moo's for ice cream. Who can resist that? Then Ben, Jason, Shayna and I decided to go see Spiderman 2 since Jason and Shayna hadn't seen it yet. I saw it last week up in Traverse with Cession but I was more than willing to see it again! What a great movie! Then we came home for Mom's famous Sunday night pizza and we watched Ice Age.  In the midst of all that today I still managed to get all my pictures from the last week and a half together and into a web photo album! Make sure you check out the pics from  urlLink Elk Lake  and  urlLink Shelley's wedding ! I also have links to them under 'Living the Point' on my menu to the right. I talked to Ked a couple times today (he helped me get online with my parents internet and get my pictures posted). He said I did a great job taking the pictures! That makes me feel good because he is the creative genius in our family, and I was using his camera and I don't know very much about it!!  Oh, in other big news tonight--- my younger brother Jason got engaged this morning!! He asked Shayna to marry him this morning at a park. They didn't tell us until tonight. I noticed her ring at lunch, and the thought crossed my mind that they might be engaged. But then since no one had said anything I didn't think much of it, especially since she works at a jewelry store. I thought it was just a nice ring she bought. So we are all excited for them!! Congratulations guys! We love you!  Well, it sounds like everyone is still going strong downstairs, but if I'm going to keep up with them and their planned shopping spree tomorrow, I should think about going to bed!!               "

There is a link below the news item (as of this posting it read '74 comments) -- several pages of discussion.  I use it mainly at work or connected to a stereo at home, so it's usually plugged into an outlet anyway.  So as a user I may not be comparable to the campus-roaming users who rely on the battery daily for months on end.         "

They are just like animal crackers, only instead of a rhino, there is an Uncle Sam, instead of a Giraffe, there is an American Flag.

589736,male,Technology,"   Once the party discovers what happened to Castillion (a mystery that technically matters directly to only two present characters -- Gregory and Ian), the group will be at an interesting crux:  What Next?  The party is now international in membership, and global (and beyond) in awareness of The World.  The mysteries and challenges that have been placed on the table are definitely different from how the story began.  This may be frustrating to some, and I understand the desire for simplicity (Let's Just Get The Ring to Mount Doom), but it was always my intention to create a broad, organic world within which various characters could pursue adventure and glory.  I had done the Single Through-Line campaign before; I was interested in trying something with fewer (if any) boundaries.  The catch, though, is that the game began with certain set archetypes, if you will -- various Local Yokels and a couple of Wild Cards who set out to figure something out -- and those archetypes may, very reasonably, strain a bit at the edges as they move beyond the comfort zone of what they originally intended and expected to do.  Which is kind of my point -- what do the players feel about their characters' comfort zones?  Of the current party, Fennie and Connor are the most likely to pursue adventure for its own sake.  Rhanellus has a personal journey to take that seems, at the moment, to be connected to the Big Picture in some unknown way.  Adan has a spiritual calling to Right What Has Been Changed, and it is natural for him to roam the world on that quest.  Luc, like Rhanellus, has a personal journey that seems linked somehow to the events of the world -- specifically, the often-mentioned return of the Demon Kings.  But then, there are other issues:  Connor would probably like to find the other two thirds of the Codex one day; Fennie would like to put this map to the Dragon's Graveyard to use before she dies; Luc would like to know who made her a 'key,' and can it be undone; and Rhanellus wants to go wherever clues lead him to his own self-knowledge.  Each of these goals is, unlike the World In Crisis situation, not only individual and unique, but geographically diverse -- to the point:  Candlekeep, the Citadel of the Raven, the mountains on the other side of the Dalelands, Cormyr, Zhentil Keep, and the distant land of Thay.  Talk about an Indiana Jones red line map crawl.  And then:  What of Gregory?  Does he feel a pull to move beyond his comfort zone, or is it a natural evolution for him to remain in the Central Heartlands of Faerun, patrolling the darkness that lurks therein?  Likewise, what of Ian?  Should he return to the monastery and report what he has learned, or is he a free agent?  I'm not declaring anything here -- just sharing some observations from this side of the screen.  What we have now is the result of something I have personally always wanted to do, but never tried -- a game world that spans centuries, nations, and even continents and oceans.  There is room for everyone, and for every player in the saga, Glory Awaits.  But what Glory will that be?  The Local Hero?  The Regional Hero?  The Hero of the Land?  The Hero of a World?  Or the Hero of the Multiverse?  Certainly questions worth thinking about.  As I mentioned in the previous post, all characters are welcome to follow their path to Glory from the point where they started.  Likewise, players are free to create new heroes should their characters evolve onto a path unique to themselves.  Unless a character dies, everyone who has been in the world will still be an active and prominent participant in the world, even if they are not represented in a game session.  Boris Borovich and Burne Trinson are out there even now, making choices that matter.  The same could be said of any character that chose to veer off on his or her own.  Personally, I like all the characters.  I enjoy their choices and their actions, both their desires and the things they don't really give a flying fig about.  All are welcome to do as they please, as they follow their own Road to Glory.  "

766556,female,indUnk,"        Munday again  Well, I survived the weekend with my 4 year old diva-ette.  It's really hard work to keep a four-year-old entertained.  We accompanied a friend to the salon, walked over to grocery store for a snack, had lunch at Denny's (an adventure all on it's own!), went to the park, then the pool, where we got rained out.  All of this was before 4pm on Saturday!     It was great fun playing leap frog with her last night before bed time.  I need a nap.  Diva out.           "
